A close relationship between these three species is in agreement with earlier studies (Johnson and O’Brien 1997, Bininda-Emonds&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em> </em>1999, Mattern and MacLennan 2000).&#160;</p><br/>Krausman and Morales (2005) list five Cheetah subspecies:&#160;<br/><br/><em>A. j. hecki</em>&#160;Hilzheimer, 1913: Northwest Africa&#160;<br/><em>A. j. fearsoni</em>&#160;(Smith, 1834): East Africa&#160;<br/><em>A. j. jubatus</em>&#160;(Schreber, 1775): Southern Africa&#160;<br/><em>A. j. soemmerringi</em>&#160;(Fitzinger, 1855): Northeast Africa&#160;<br/><em>A. j. venaticus</em>&#160;(Griffith, 1821): North Africa to central India&#160;<br/><br/>Only&#160;<em>A. j. jubatus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>A. j. raineyii&#160;</em>have been compared using genetic analysis, and found to be extremely similar, but the subspecies distinction was still retained (O’Brien&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em> 1987).&#160;<br/><br/>The subspecies&#160;<em>A. j. venaticus</em>, commonly called the Asiatic Cheetah, is considered by Nowell and Jackson (1996) to survive only in Iran. They place the eastern limit of its range in Arabia. However, the review by Krausman and Morales (2005) included Cheetahs from the northern Sahara in <em>venaticus</em>. The type locality of&#160;<em>A. j. venaticus</em>&#160;(=<em>Felis venatica</em>&#160;[Griffith, 1821]) is unknown (Krausman and Morales 2005). At a November 2006 meeting of the North African Region Cheetah Action Group (NARCAG), Belbachir (2007) recommended genetic studies to clarify whether the Cheetahs of Algeria (which probably has the largest Saharan Cheetah population) should be classified as&#160;<em>A. j. hecki</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>A. j. venaticus</em>. Presently&#160;<em>A. j. venaticus</em>&#160;is considered restricted to Asia.&#160;<br/><br/>The English name is derived from the Hindi Chita, meaning ""spotted one"". The generic name&#160;<em>Acinonyx</em>&#160;is a reference to its non-retractile claws (Caro 1994)."

The latest phylogeographical analyses (Driscoll <em>et al. </em>2007, 2009; Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2010) suggest that the Wildcat consists of five subspecific groups and three traditional subspecies (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2013): including the recent recognition of the Southern African Wildcat (<em>F. s. cafra</em> Desmarest, 1822).<br/><br/>Based on genetic, morphological and archaeological evidence, the familiar housecat was believed to have been domesticated from the Near Eastern Wildcat (<em>F. s. lybica</em>), probably 9,000–10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent region (Vigne <em>et al. </em>2004, Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007), coinciding with the first agricultural settlements (Driscoll <em>et al.</em> 2007, Macdonald <em>et al. </em>2010). Although the domestic cat derived relatively recently from the Wildcat, in terms of biological processes and phylogeny, it can be taxonomically classified either as a subspecies (<em>F. s. catus</em>) of<em> F. silvestris </em>or as a separate species (<em>F. catus</em>) (Macdonald <em>et al.</em> 2010). Recent evidence supports the classification of domestic cats as genetically distinct from Wildcats (Driscoll <em>et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>For the purposes of this assessment, although we recognise the potential validity of the Southern African Wildcat (<em>F. s. cafra</em>), we defer to the species level until further research can accurately delineate subspecific geographical boundaries."

The genus <em>Leopardus</em> includes most small Neotropical felids, and speciation within it has been relatively recent compared to other felid lineages (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2006).  While there is strong support for inclusion of the Andean Cat in this genus based on genetic analysis, how closely it is related to the Pampas Cat <em>L. colocolo</em> remains unclear.  The classification of the Andean Cat as <em>Oreailurus</em> was based in part, from very few specimens, on the relative size difference in the skull's auditory chambers, but this trait is also found in other felid species (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1998, Garcia-Perea 2002).  The specific name, <em>jacobita</em>, is in honour of Jacobita Mantagazza (Cornalia 1865) and should not be declined to <em>jacobitus</em> (Yensen and Seymour 2000) as is sometimes seen in the literature.

The Borneo Bay Cat is not a small island form of the Asiatic Golden Cat, as previously thought, having diverged from its extant relatives approximately four million years ago, well before the separation of Borneo from the mainland (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1999, O'Brien and Johnson 2007).<br/><br/>An evaluation of skull morphology by Sicuro and Oliveira (2011) revealed that skull structure in <em>Pardofelis </em>is quite different from that in <em>Catopuma</em>. Moreover, <em>Pardofelis </em>has a flexible ankle joint and elongated tail, presumably adaptations to arboreality, which are lacking in <em>Catopuma</em>. Based on these morphological differences and the early split of the Asiatic Golden Cat and the Borneo Bay Cat from the Marbled Cat in the Late Miocene (5.86 Mya), the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group retains both the Borneo Bay Cat and Asiatic Golden Cat in <em>Catopuma </em>(CCTF in prep.)"

Based on these results, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group has provisionally proposed a different split into two subspecies, <em>P</em>. <em>l</em>. <em>leo</em> of Asia and West, Central and North Africa; and <em>P</em>. <em>l</em>.<em> melanochaita</em> from South and East Africa, with several regional management units identified as well (Haas et al. 2005; Bertola et al. 2011, 2015; Bauer et al. 2015)."

Although eight subspecies have been recognized (Seymour 1989), morphological and genetic analyses do not support the existence of discrete subspecies (Larson 1997, Eizirik <em>et al.</em> 2001, Ruiz-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2006). While not elevating the regional differences to the subspecies level, Eizirk <em>et al.</em> (2001) found evidence for four incompletely isolated phylogeographic groups: Mexico and Guatemala, southern Central America, northern South America, and South America south of the Amazon River. Similarly, Ruiz-Garcia <em>et al.</em> (2006) found that the Andes Mountains incompletely isolates Jaguar populations in Colombia."

The Serval taxonomy is currently under review by the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group (Thiel 2015). Only one subspecies is recognised from within the assessment region, <em>L</em>. <em>s</em>.<em> serval</em> (Meester <em>et al</em>. 1986)."

8542,Felis nigripes,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CARNIVORA,MAMMALIA,FELIDAE,Felis,nigripes,,,,,"Burchell, 1824","Two subspecies have been described and these persist in theory (Meester <em>et al.</em> 1986). <em>Felis nigripes nigripes</em>, the nominate genotype form described by Burchell, was first described from near Kuruman in the Northern Cape. Its range includes present-day south eastern Namibia, Botswana, Northern Cape, North West, Gauteng, Limpopo and marginally into Mpumalanga. <em>Felis nigripes thomasi</em> (Shortridge 1931) is described from a specimen collected near Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape. Its range includes the present-day Eastern Cape, westwards to the southern regions of the Northern Cape and the Free State.<br/><br/>However, Smithers (1971) doubted the validity of two subspecies, and his thought is shared by Sliwa (2013) who suggests that the species may be polymorphic in the centre of its range but does exhibit on some geocline variations towards the extremes of its range. The northern race typically tends to be paler with less distinct striping whereas the southern race has a more tawny appearance with bolder patterning. However, since there are no obvious geographical or ecological barriers between the ranges which are the leading causes of genetic drift and speciation (Hoskin <em>et al.</em> 2005), it is likely that the subspecies status is invalid (Wilson 2016)."
