50649567,219,Acinonyx jubatus,Vulnerable,A2acd; C1,2015,2014-05-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The known Cheetah population is roughly 6,700 adult and adolescent animals distributed across 29 subpopulations. These estimates are very approximate, and are derived from largely expert assessment and from the extent of known resident Cheetah range multiplied by density, however, they constitute the best available information. The global population estimate can be broken down regionally into an estimated 4,190 adults in Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a, in prep.); 1,960 adults in Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); 440 adults in Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012); and 80 adults in Iran (Hunter et al. </em>2007, Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). &#160;There is only a single subpopulation with an estimated size of more than 1,000 individuals, and only one additional subpopulation larger than 500, the remaining 27 known subpopulations are estimated to hold less than 500 individuals. Additional areas where Cheetah status is poorly known are unlikely to raise the total to over 10,000.<br/><br/>Generation time for a Cheetah is estimated at 4.9 years using the formula GL = Rspan*z +AFR (Pacifici&#160;et al. </em>2013). AFR =age at first reproduction 2 years (Durant et al.</em> 2004); Rspan = reproductive lifespan, which is the age at last reproduction 12 years (Durant et al.</em> 2004) - age of first reproduction 2 years = 10 years; z = 0.29, and is a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici et al.</em> 2013). Three Cheetah generations are thus approximately 15 years.<br/><br/>Because of the difficulty in estimating density for a wide ranging scarce carnivore like the Cheetah, there is little accurate information on population decline. In Africa we estimate that known resident Cheetah range today occupies 2,709,054 km<sup>2</sup>, while historic range was 25,344,648 km<sup>2</sup> - a decline of 89%. This decline in range is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation; killing and capture of Cheetahs due to livestock depredation; and loss of prey (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Illegal trade is likely to have a big impact in some areas, notably the Horn of Africa (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>If we assume the bulk of this decline was exponential at a fixed percentage per year and started 100 years ago (at the onset of rapid anthropogenic environmental change), then this amounts to a loss of range of 2.26% per year. This constant rate of decline results in an estimated resident range of 3,643,882 km<sup>2</sup> in 1999, three Cheetah&#160;generations ago (15 years). This results in an estimated decline of 29% resident range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>While some of unknown range and probable range may contain Cheetah, which would increase the estimated resident's range, this is unlikely to make a substantial change. If probable resident range is included with resident range (total 4,804,254 km<sup>2</sup>), this results in a 22% decline from historical range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>However, it is unlikely that the rate of decline in Cheetah range has remained constant over the last 100 years. Drivers of decline, such as conflict, loss of prey, habitat change, are likely to have decreased disproportionately with range occupancy (Lindsey et al.</em> 2011, Durant et al.</em> 2014), resulting in a recent acceleration in range collapse. Thus, a decline of at least 30% in abundance and extent of occurrence is strongly suspected over the last three Cheetah generations, and a decline of at least 10% is likely over the next three generations.<br/><br/>Subspecies in Iran (A. j. venaticus</em>) and northwest Africa (A. j. heckii</em>) are listed as Critically Endangered. &#160;The Cheetah is also assessed as Critically Endangered in the region of North and West Africa.</p>","In Africa, Cheetahs are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions, ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012; Durant et al.</em> 2014). They are only absent from tropical and montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Hunter et al.</em> 2007c), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second) (Sharp 1997). However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson et al.</em> 2013a, b). Cheetahs make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of metres. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle, kob and impala. But their prey can range from ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large ungulates such as wildebeest, kudu or eland (Purchase and du Toit 2000, Broomhall et al. </em>2003, Mills et al. </em>2004, Cooper et al. </em>2007, Hilborn et al.</em> 2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Bbex Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species, although livestock comprises a substantial proportion of the diet (Hunter et al.</em> 2007c, Farhadinia et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Cheetahs, unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with high densities of large carnivore competitors, cheetah can lose up to around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and spotted hyaenas (Hunter et al.</em> 2007a), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter et al.</em> 2007b). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use visual cues to avoid competitors is a key driver of diurnal behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir et al.</em> 2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower number of competitors or an increase in human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant et al. </em>2007, Durant et al.</em> 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three (Caro 1994, Broomhall et al. </em>2003, Marnewick et al.</em> 2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetahs appear to mate with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female Cheetahs follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km<sup>2</sup>) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant et al.</em> 1988, Caro 1994). However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females may have overlapping ranges that can be more similar in size (Broomhall et al. </em>2003). On Namibian farmlands, where prey is also non-migratory, both Cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km<sup>2</sup>); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range. The reasons for such large home ranges are unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002). It has been hypothesised that the Cheetah’s unique social system and ranging patterns originally evolved as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a, b). This is supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by cheetah in Botswana and South Africa (Broekhuis et al. </em>2013, Rostro-Garcia et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the wild Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant et al.</em> 2010b). Cheetahs give birth to their first litter at two years after a three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub mortality can be high. In the Serengeti 95% of cubs died before independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson et al.</em> 1992). Elsewhere cub mortality is reported to be nowhere much lower, although information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey Badgers, jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role.<br/>&#160;<br/>If cubs survive, they will stay with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). At this time, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single males may meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition. In the Serengeti mean annual mortality for females and males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1-2 year olds; and 0.15 and 0.31 for adults (Durant et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large predators (Marker et al. </em>2003c, Durant et al. </em>2004). It is difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti adult Cheetahs have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and one individual died from encephalitis (Durant et al. </em>2010b). Male cheetahs are killed by other males, probably during territorial disputes (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, Cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant 2007). The highest density recorded for Cheetah, not including small and highly managed fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park, where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Durant et al.</em> 2011), but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Caro 1994), which can give a misleading impression of over-inflated densities. Caro (1994) attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as Lions and hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors, Cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>) (Marker 2002) and 0.23 per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir et al. </em>2015), respectively. In such environments cheetah may be limited by prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant 1998, 2000a, c; Broekhuis et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia et al.</em> 2015), while in other environments impacts of competitors may be much lower (Mills and Mills 2014).","As a wide ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Conserving viable subpopulations of Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that Cheetah require for their survival may be protected, unprotected, or a combination of the two. Cheetahs also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving connecting habitat.<br/><br/>Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn et al.</em> 2013; Dickman et al.</em> 2014). While Cheetahs tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers in retaliation (Marker et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman et al. </em>2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetahs are seen as competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that they are difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant et al. </em>2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other carnivores such as hyaenas, leopards and lions.<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir et al.</em> 2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion may directly impact cheetah populations. Prey loss can also have serious indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent where wild prey are depleted (Marker et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying conflict with livestock farmers.<br/><br/>Cheetah may also become captured in snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary target (Lindsey et al. </em>2013). While effects on Cheetah populations are not well quantified, snared Cheetah are reported occasionally and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High speed roads also represent a threat to Cheetah populations. This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khavd Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah mortalities between 2005 and 2011 due to various human-causes, at least 11 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Turan, Bafq and Dare Anjir protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). In separate incidents in 2014 two Cheetahs were hit and terminally injured by cars on the dirt main road through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, while deaths have also been reported on many other roads including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such mortality could have a significant impact on the viability of small and isolated populations of Cheetah.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe et al.</em> 1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12-15% of their total time spent wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe et al.</em> 1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference with Cheetahs hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975, 1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. A large number of vehicles around a Cheetah can also restrict its view, and there has been an unconfirmed report of a Cheetah being killed by a Lion whose approach was masked by vehicles. There have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close up photographs. &#160;In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease (notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro et al. </em>1987, Gakuya et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull et al. </em>2004)), the low density of Cheetah mean that infectious disease is unlikely to present a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses. Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is an increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations which may no longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in Iran (Dehghan 2013).<br/><br/>All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant et al. </em>2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter et al. </em>2007, Durant et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir et al.</em> 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.<br/><br/>While the threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to foster Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetahs occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife. Meanwhile a lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes are leading to ever increasing subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation. These drivers will also need to be addressed if the immediate threats are to be reduced.","Where possible population estimates are based on expert information from in-depth surveys and monitoring. This was particularly the case in the southern Africa estimates (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep). Where expert based information was not available, population estimates were derived from applying density estimates from comparable areas to resident range as mapped during conservation strategy workshops. Density estimates were conservative, since many sites where abundance is unknown are likely to face higher pressures than sites where there is better information on abundance. Four density estimates were used:<br/><br/>1) For well managed protected areas density was estimated at one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, slightly higher than Kruger National Park, but lower than the volcanic savannas of the Serengeti ecosystem (Bowland 1995, Durant et al.</em> 2011);<br/>2) For areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (Marker 2002);<br/>3) For the Sahara density was estimated at one individual per 4,000 km<sup>2</sup>, using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir et al.</em> 2015); and<br/>4) For two subpopulations in west and central Africa density was estimated at one individual per 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>, consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with elevated pressures and direct threats in these regions.<br/><br/>The population estimates so derived for Cheetah as presented here, including the expert based estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in a large overall change in population estimates. Population estimates refer to adults and independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs.<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the Cheetah’s regional stronghold, holding a rough estimate of 4,190 adults and independent adolescents distributed across ten subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007b; Marnewick et al.</em> 2007; Purchase 2007a, b; Purchase et al.</em> 2007, Purchase and Purchase 2007; Williams 2007; Chilufya and Purchase 2011; Andresen et al.</em> 2012; IUCN SSC in prep.). The largest of these subpopulations supports an estimated 3,940 individuals, comprising the majority of the regional population, which is spread across a large transboundary landscape covering Botswana, Namibia, northern South Africa, south-western Zambia and south-western Mozambique.<br/><br/>The other nine subpopulations are much smaller: 60 individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 50 in and around Hwange National Park; 46 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save Conservancy; 40 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe; 20 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 12 in Mana Pools; 10 in Bahine National Park; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe. The latter subpopulation has decreased substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid 1990s and may indicate long term viability of Cheetah populations in small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase et al.</em> 2006). A large proportion of the estimated subpopulation in the region lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas, have been extirpated from much of this range. There are also around 293 Cheetahs in an intensively managed meta-population distributed across small fenced reserves in South Africa (van der Merwe and K. Marnewick pers comms.) that we have excluded from the overall population estimates.<br/><br/>The Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents distributed across 15 subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007a). Only four of these subpopulations are estimated to number 200 animals or more. In descending order of estimated population size the 15 subpopulations are: 710 individuals in the Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo landscape in Kenya and Tanzania; 450 in the Laikipia/Samburu landscape in Kenya; 250 in the Omo Mago/Borena protected areas and buffer zones in Ethiopia; 200 in the Ruaha landscape in Tanzania; 190 in Boma National Park in South Sudan; 150 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 130 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 110 in the Ogaden landscape in Ethiopia; 100 in the Maasai steppe in Tanzania; 70 in each of the Blen-Afar National Park in Ethiopia and Badingilo National Park in South Sudan; 60 in Radom National Park in South Sudan; 40 in the Afar landscape in Ethiopia; 30 in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in Ethiopia; and 12 in the Kidepo National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan (IUCN SSC 2007a). A large proportion of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2007a).<br/><br/>The number of known resident Cheetahs in western, central and northern Africa &#160;is estimated at 446 adults and independent adolescents distributed across four populations (IUCN SSC 2012). These are: 217 individuals in Bahr/Salamat landscape in Chad and CAR; 201 in the Adrar des Ifhogas/Ahaggar/AjjarTassili landscape in Algeria and Mali; 23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; 4 in Air et Tenere connected to another 1-2 individuals in the Termit Massiff, both in Niger. As in the other regions, a large proportion of Cheetah range in this region is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2012, Belbachir et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Asia, Cheetahs are now confined to Iran, where the subspecies Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</em> is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter et al.</em> 2007c) and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>The total known Cheetah population is therefore very provisionally estimated at around 6,674 adults and independent adolescents. Thus the population is extremely unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, meeting the criteria for Vulnerable. The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) using data from a long term study population of Cheetah in the Serengeti ecosystem is estimated at &#160;2,937 or, if skewed female heritability is taken into account, this is reduced to 1,001 (Kelly 2001). While Cheetah female reproductive success is highly skewed, genetic analysis showed that female Cheetahs mated with multiple males, many from outside the study area, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity (Gottelli et al.</em> 2007). This suggests that male reproductive success may be less skewed than expected, but it also underscores the importance of Cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.<br/><br/>The low density of the Cheetah across their range means they need large areas of connected habitat for their survival. The facts that the majority of known Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands, and that their populations are extremely fragmented are causes for concern.","The total known Cheetah population is therefore very provisionally estimated at around 6,674 adults and independent adolescents",Decreasing,"Cheetahs have disappeared from vast tracts of their historic range. In Africa they are now known to persist in only 10% of their historic range (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep.), while their distribution in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran.<br/><br/>In Africa, Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, but there has been significant range loss across all regions. In Eastern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in only 6% of their historical range in (310,586 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (IUCN/SSC 2007a). Significant Cheetah range occurs in the transboundary areas between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. Almost the entire southern boundary of Ethiopia is recorded as resident Cheetah range with connectivity into South Sudan and this population almost certainly extends into northern Kenya. Important subpopulations of Cheetah survive elsewhere in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, as well as in South Sudan and northern Uganda but are notably fragmented across the region. Their status in Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in 22% of their historical range (1,223,388 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 403,627 km<sup>2</sup> (IUCN SSC in prep.). Most of the Cheetahs surviving in this region are in a single transboundary population stretching across Namibia, Botswana, south-western Angola, northern South Africa, south-western Mozambique and southern Zambia. Important populations also survive elsewhere in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase et al.</em> 2007). There are some reliable observations of cheetah from south-eastern Angola (Anon. 2010), close to the Namibia and Zambia borders. Cheetahs have been extirpated from Malawi (Purchase and Purchase 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined particularly markedly in western, central and northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012, Durant et al. </em>2014). The subspecies found in northwest Africa, A. j. hecki,</em> is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information. Cheetah now occur in 10% of their historical range (1,053,746 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 920,520 km<sup>2</sup>. Much of this range is within the Sahara, where Cheetah occur at very low densities, estimated as 2.3 individuals per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir et al. </em>2015). There are five known Cheetah subpopulations in this region (IUCN SSC 2012): south-central Algeria, stretching through to north-eastern Mali, and possibly into western Libya (Belbachir et al. </em>2015); two connected subpopulations around the Termit massif in Niger; the WAP complex of protected areas in northern Benin, south-eastern Burkina Faso and south-western Niger; and south-eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic (CAR). Cheetah have been extirpated from their historical range in Western Sahara, Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, DRC and Ghana. The last reliable Cheetah sighting in Cameroon was in the 1970s (de Iongh et al</em>. 2011), and no tracks were found in an extensive search of the Benoue Complex in 2007 and 2010, which was their last refuge in the country (Croes et al.</em> 2011). Recent extensive surveys for Lion in the best protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria found no evidence of Cheetah (Henschel et al. </em>2014a, b). It is also unlikely any Cheetah survive in Egypt. Reports from hunters suggest that cheetah may persist in south-western Libya (IUCN SSC 2012), but the status of Cheetah from much of southern Libya, northern Niger, Chad and CAR remains unknown.<br/><br/>In Asia, the Cheetah has been extirpated from nearly all of its range. Its historic range extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Habibi 2003, Mallon 2007). One reason for their extirpation across most of their Asian range is thought to have been the live capture of cheetahs, which were then trained to hunt deer and gazelle as sport for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh 1995). Other key causes of the disappearance of Cheetah from the region are likely to have been depletion of wild prey, especially gazelles, the direct killing of Cheetahs, and anthropogenic change and fragmentation of their habitat (Mallon 2007). The Asiatic Cheetah (A. j. venaticus</em>) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered. Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001). Habibi (2003) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, although a Cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.). More detail can be found in the subspecies account for A. j. venaticus</em>.","Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah has been reported as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia. A recent resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been of sufficient global concern to gain the attention of CITES (CITES 2013). Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally to the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana &#160;(CITES 1992). From 2002-2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Official records show that, on average, only three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetahs are reported to CITES per year, however, this is an underestimate of the real trade (Nowell 2014). Most of these Cheetahs are destined for the pet trade market in the Gulf States. These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports. Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.<br/><br/>East Africa is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetahs is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Most countries in East Africa have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans. Trade in live Cheetahs has been ongoing for some time (for example, between 1998-2002, 39 Cheetah cubs smuggled primarily out of Somalia were confiscated by Customs authorities of the United Arab Emirates). Between 2011-13 over 40 Cheetah confiscations were reported, primarily in the semi-autonomous region of Somaliland, with many more observations and second-hand reports of illegal trade in cubs (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia. Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond.<br/><br/>The primary destination of live Cheetahs from this region are the Gulf States, and the primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetahs (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetahs are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetahs in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetahs (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun et al. </em>(2013)), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetahs. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetahs between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.<br/><br/>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar et al</em>. 2008), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation.",Terrestrial,"The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Most Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands where they are often persecuted in retaliation for livestock or game depredation.<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control regulations (Purchase et al. </em>2007). There is very rarely any systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way. Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range states are actively involved with the Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), which has supported them in the development of regional strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are combined in this process because of their similar low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three regional strategies in place for Africa covering all of Cheetah range: Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); and Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012).<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, these strategies also provide a framework for national conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most range states (dates of the planning workshop in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009), Zimbabwe (2009), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Namibia (2013). In addition, Cheetah are covered in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National Conservation Action Plan (2010). These 15 action plans cover all or part of 26 of the 27 known Cheetah subpopulations and 67% of known Cheetah range (the majority of remaining range is in Algeria). Each national conservation action plan is published by the range state wildlife authority and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah (and Wild Dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats as well as the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is overseen by three regional co-ordinators. There are also a number of different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that benefit Cheetah, and some also provide support for capacity development of national wildlife authorities. There are no long-term initiatives in northern, western or central Africa, but there are some new developments in this region.<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected. The main protected areas for this species are Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh Protected Area and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge (Hunter et al. </em>2007c). The UNDP have established a program of work to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah, and a conservation planning workshop took place in 2008, leading to an action plan. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought to be extinct in the country.<br/><br/>The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (<a href=""http://www.catsg.org"">www.catsg.org</a>) which provides a useful resource for publications relating to all aspects of Cheetah ecology and conservation.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50663128,18306,Caracal aurata,Vulnerable,A2c+3c,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The African Golden Cat is a forest-dependent species restricted to equatorial Africa, where high deforestation and bushmeat hunting levels are causing substantial reductions in their area of occupancy (AOO). Data on the extent of African Golden Cat AOO loss is unavailable due to a lack of population monitoring. We can infer, however, an approximate AOO loss using data on deforestation and bushmeat hunting, as well as evidence of the effects of these on African Golden Cats.<br/><br/>We infer that the cumulative loss of AOO from deforestation and bushmeat hunting along expanding road networks amounts to &gt;30% in the past 15 years (three Golden Cat generations; Pacifici et al</em>. 2013) and qualifies the African Golden Cat for Vulnerable status under criterion A2c. Additionally, the exacerbation of these threats due to population growth, projected mining activities and forest clearance for oil palm plantations will likely cause further reduction in AOO for the Golden Cat and we therefore predict that the AOO will be reduced by at least a further 30% in the next 15 years, lending additional support to the species’ listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.<br/><p></p>","While the Neotropical and Indomalayan regions have several sympatric forest-dependent felid species, this is Africa's only one.  The African Golden Cat occurs mainly in primary moist equatorial forest, although on the periphery of its range it penetrates savanna regions along riverine forest.  It also occurs in montane forest and alpine moorland in the east of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray and Butynski 2013). &#160;<br/><br/>Two studies of scats - from the Ituri forest of the Congo (Hart et al.</em> 1996) and the Dzanga-Sangha forest of the Central African republic (Ray and Sunquist 2001) - found similar results.  Rodents and squirrels were the main prey item (70 % and 62% respectively), followed by small and medium-size duikers (antelopes) (25% and 33% respectively.  Primates made up 5% of the prey items in both studies, and there have been several observations by primate researchers of African Golden Cats hunting arboreal primates (Ray and Butynski 2013, Bahaa-el-din et al. </em>in review).  The same general diet items were reported by Kingdon (1977) from Uganda's Bwindi National Park.  Birds are also taken, and pangolin remains were frequently found in scats from the Ivory Coast's Tai National Park (D. Jenny pers. comm. in Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/><br/>African Golden Cats have turned up in the diet of leopards, the only other felid to occur in African moist forest.  African Golden Cat remains were found in five of 196 Leopard Panthera pardus</em> scats from Gabon's Lopé National Park (Henschel et al.</em> 2005); a single carcass killed by a Leopard was found in the Ituri (Hart et al.</em> 1996).","At least 6.5% of forest (projected from FAO 2011) in Golden Cat range countries has been lost in the past three Golden Cat generations (15 years, Pacifici et al</em>. 2013). This translates into, at minimum, an equivalent loss of range for the Golden Cat as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. Prior to the year 2000, West and East Africa had already suffered an 88-92% reduction in rainforest, while Central Africa’s rainforest extent was reduced by 40% (Laurance et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Intensive hunting for bushmeat (&gt;1 million tonnes per year harvested in the Congo Basin, the species’ main stronghold; Wilkie and Carpenter 1999), leading to ‘empty forest syndrome’ (Sayer 1992), likely accounts for greater reduction in area of occupancy (AOO) for the Golden Cat than deforestation, but is more difficult to quantify. Within 10–15 km of roads and settlements, large and medium bodied mammals experience sharp declines in population (Laurance et al</em>. 2006, Blake et al.</em> 2007, Henschel 2008). In excess of 64% of forest habitat in the Congo Basin lies within 10 km of a road and is also predicted to be affected by higher hunting pressure (Blake et al</em>. 2007). Development of roads increased rapidly in the past 15 years (e.g. 35% increase in the Democratic Republic of Congo and &gt;300% increase in northern Republic of Congo since the year 2000; Laporte et al</em>. 2007). Golden Cat populations within these highly impacted areas are likely to be severely reduced or extirpated through direct mortality and loss of prey.<br/><br/>Golden cats are often not a primary target species, but are frequently killed by wire-snares (four individuals in two months in 20 km<sup>2</sup> in Gabon; Bahaa-el-din pers. obs.; and 13 individuals in three months in Lobéké, Cameroon; Ray et al.</em> 2005), probably owing to similarities in body size and trail use to target species such as duikers. In an area of moderate bushmeat hunting, Golden Cats were recorded at less than a quarter of the population densities that they are found at in pristine areas (Bahaa-el-din et al</em>. in prep). Where more intense hunting occurs, such as in village hunting areas (e.g. Dibouka village in central Gabon; Henschel 2008) and national parks (e.g. Korup NP in southwest Cameroon; TEAM, http://www.teamnetwork.org), camera trap and bushmeat studies did not record the species despite the presence of suitable habitat contiguous with the main forest of the Congo Basin.<br/><br/>Recent landscape-scale Golden Cat surveys in mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) emphasize that prior range estimates based on forest cover may have significantly overestimated remaining golden cat range. An estimated 78% of Rio Muni consists of tropical dense forest and therefore putatively suitable habitat, but Golden Cats were found to occupy just 16% of the area (Martinez Marti 2011). Its presence in the area was correlated with rugged, inaccessible terrain away from human disturbance (Martinez Marti 2011). Golden Cats were reported by locals to be easy to hunt and locally extirpated long before other medium-to-large mammal species (Martinez Marti 2011).<br/><br/>These threats will intensify, as the human population within the species’ range shows the fastest growth rates in the world (+2.6-2.8% per annum for West, Central and East Africa; FAO 2011). The population in main Golden Cat range countries, estimated at nearly a quarter of a billion for 2013, is projected to almost quadruple by 2100 (UN 2012, <a href=""http:////esa.un.org/wpp/"">http://esa.un.org/wpp/</a>).<br/><br/>The current “stampede of foreign investment” in mining activities and associated infrastructure development in Africa is of immediate concern (Edwards et al</em>. 2014). In Central Africa, 42% of ecologically important areas would be directly impacted if there were complete development of mineral resources in the region (assuming that ecological impacts extend within 10 km of mines; Edwards et al. 2014). China’s mineral investment alone has quadrupled in 10 years (Zhang 2011). In addition, it is predicted that the conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, which has caused extensive loss of forest habitat and biodiversity in Southeast Asia, will have similar impacts in Africa (particularly in West and Central Africa) as it expands over the coming years (Wich et al</em>. 2014). The realisation of these investments includes habitat destruction and degradation, relocation of human populations into previously remote areas and massive-scale infrastructural development including road and rail which in turn lead to the aforementioned surge in bushmeat hunting in these areas (Edwards et al</em>. 2014).","<p>The African Golden Cat is infrequently observed in the wild, and generally considered rare.

102424310,3847,Caracal caracal,Least Concern,,2016,2014-05-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large geographical distribution covering a wide range of environments, Caracal is subject to different pressures and threats that vary in extent and severity resulting in very different local population trends. While the species is considered as Least Concerned in Arabian Peninsula (Mallon and Budd 2011), it is listed as Endangered in Jordan (GCEP 2000), Critically Endangered in Pakistan (Sheikh and Molur 2004) and Morocco (Cuzin 2003). It is already vanished in Kuwait (Cowan 2013), parts of Turkmenistan (Lukarevsky 2001) and believed to be on the verge of extinction in many parts of North Africa (Cuzin 2003, F. Belbachir, pers. comm. 2014). However, while it shows such signs of population declines and range loss in parts of Asia and Northern Africa, Caracal is very common and stable in central and southern Africa (Thorn et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011) which covers a large fraction of its global range. Because the declines are highly local and none cause a significant range loss in relation to its global population, the species is considered as Least Concern.","The Caracal occupies a wide variety of habitats from semi-desert to relatively open savanna and scrubland to moist woodland and thicket or evergreen/montane forest (as in the Western Cape of South Africa), but favours drier woodland and savanna regions with lower rainfall and some cover (Stuart and Stuart 2013, TAWIRI 2009). While drier open country is preferred, they are absent from true desert and are usually associated with some form of vegetative cover (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). On the Arabian Peninsula they mainly occur in desert wadis, foothills, mountains and basalt fields (Mallon and Budd 2011). They range up to 2,500 m and exceptionally 3,300 m (exceptionally) in the Ethiopian Highlands (Ray et al.</em></em></em> 2005). Caracal prey mainly on small- to medium-sized mammals, from small murids to antelope up to ~50 kg, but they will also take birds, reptiles (such as lizards and snakes), invertebrates, fish, and some plant matter (Stuart and Stuart 2007, 2013; Hunter 2004; Ghoddousi et al.</em></em></em> 2009; Mallon and Budd 2011). In a study in the Cape province, Southern Africa, the diet was dominated by rodents (&gt;70%, Braczkowski et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Also in India and Iran, rodents seem to play an important role in the Caracal’s diet (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Farhadinia et al.</em></em></em> 2008). Like cheetahs, Caracals were captured and trained to hunt for Indian royalty, but although it is capable of taking the larger ungulates it was mainly used for small game and birds (Divyabhanusinh 1995). Caracals often scavenge (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Occasionally, Caracals prey on livestock such as goats, sheep or poultry (Stuart and Stuart 2007, Kolipaka 2011, Albayrak et al</em>. 2012). Caracals have very good bird hunting skills. They can grab a flushed bird from the air with a high leap (Hunter 2004). In Datça Peninsula, Turkey, Caracals were active during day and night except for late morning or around midnight (Ilemin and Gürkan 2010). In the Hawf area, Yemen, Caracals were more active during the day (Khorozyan et al</em>. 2014). However, in a study in India, Caracals showed mainly nocturnal behavior (Singh et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Home ranges are large in arid areas, with the home ranges of three males averaging 316.4 km² on Namibian ranchland (Marker and Dickman 2005). In South Africa male home ranges were 5.1-48 km² and female ones 3.9-26.7 km² (TAWIRI 2009). In Saudi Arabia, a radio-tracked male ranged over 270 km² to 1,116 km² in different seasons (Van Heezik and Seddon 1998), while in an Israeli study, home ranges of males averaged 220.6 km² (Weisbein and Mendelssohn 1990). Male home ranges in better-watered environments of South Africa are smaller (two males averaged 26.9 km² in West Coast National Park: (Avenant and Nel 1998), and female ranges are considerably smaller than the ones of males (Stuart and Stuart 2013)). The Caracal is listed as Schedule I species by the Indian Widlife Act of 1972 (Kolipaka 2011).","As Caracals are capable of taking small domestic livestock, they are often subject to persecution. Stuart (1982) recorded that over the years 1931-1952 an average of 2,219 Caracals per year were killed in control operations in the Karoo, South Africa. Similarly, Namibian farmers responding to a government questionnaire reported killing up to 2,800 Caracals in 1981 (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Brand (1989) found that Caracals were responsible for the loss of up to 5.3 domestic stock per 100 km² per annum in the former Cape Province of South Africa. Severity of depredation appears to be dependent on the availability of wild prey and husbandry techniques (Stuart and Stuart 2013).<br/><br/>Habitat destruction (agriculture and desertification) is a significant threat in central, west, north and northeast Africa where Caracals are naturally sparsely distributed (Ray et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005). It is also likely to be the main threat in the Asian part of its range (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>On the Arabian Peninsula, habitat loss and fragmentation due to road and settlement expansion are major threats (Mallon and Budd 2011). However, also retaliation killing due to livestock predation is a threat (Mallon and Budd 2011). Additionally, prey base declines could negatively affect the Caracal too (Mallon and Budd 2011). In the United Arab Emirates, Caracals are found in the international pet trade. However, the source of these animals and the impact of this trade on the population are unknown (Mallon and Budd 2011).<br/><br/>In parts of Turkey, people dislike the species and persecute it because they think it predates on small stock animals (Albayrak et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Around Termessos National Park Caracals also get killed in road accidents (Albayrak et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Iran, major threats are attacks by herd dogs and road kills (Ghoddousi et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2009). In Afghanistan, hunting pressure and habitat loss due to the extension of agriculture are major threats causing population decline (Habibi 2004). In India, habitat loss and fragmentation and increased human disturbance are the main threats to the Caracal (Kolipaka 2011).","In sub-Saharan Africa, the Caracal is common in parts of its range, especially in South Africa and southern Namibia where it is expanding into new, and recolonizing vacant, areas, however, in central and West Africa, where they are largely absent, densities are apparently lower, possibly due to finer partitioning of resources in a more diverse carnivore community (Stuart and Stuart 2013). Avenant and Nel (1998) recorded a density of 0.23-0.47 Caracal/km² in the West Coast N.P. in the Western Cape of South Africa.<br/><br/>In &#160;north Africa, the Caracal is considered threatened (Stuart and Stuart 2013). In Egypt it is considered rare (Hunter 2004). However, as it is an elusive species, it may is more widespread than indicated by records (Hunter 2004). In northern South Africa, the Caracal is considered as common and widespread (Thorn et al.</em></em></em> </em>2011).<br/><br/>On the Arabian Peninsula, the Caracal is widespread and seems to be stable and was classified as Least Concern (Mallon and Budd 2011). Nevertheless, the species appears to be declining in some range states and may is already close to classify for Near Threatened (Mallon and Budd 2011). The Caracal is regarded as rare in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (Mallon and Budd 2011). However, the population trend in Saudi Arabia is not clear. There are some indications for a population decline based on less individuals found in road kills and less detections of the species (Mallon and Budd 2011). Also in Oman, the trend is unknown. In United Arab Emirates, the Caracal is declining whereas in Yemen it is more likely to be stable and was described as widely distributed and common in the Hawf area (Khorozyan et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The regional Caracal population is likely to fluctuate based on prey availability (Mallon and Budd 2011).<br/><br/>In Turkey, according to Albayrak et al.</em></em></em> </em>(2012), the Caracal is probably endangered in the country. Also Bunaian et al.</em></em></em></em> (2001) noted that the species is undergoing severe population declines throughout the country. In the Badia area, for example, it is considered as Endangered (Bunaian et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001). Nevertheless, there is very little information on its status and distribution in Turkey available (Albayrak et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In Iran, the Caracal population is thought to be decreasing due to habitat destruction (Hassan-Beigi et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). There are only few records from Afghanistan. The Caracal is thought to be declining in the country and is classified as threatened (Habibi 2004). The Caracal is considered rare in the Central Asian republics and India (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Caracal occurs at low densities, making it vulnerable to extinction. In India, it is estimated that &lt;10-15 animals survive in the Kutch region, Gujarat, and &lt;50 individuals in Rajasthan, (Singh et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The Caracal has a wide but patchy distribution and seems to be restricted to specific pockets in central and western India (Kolipaka 2011). Locally, the species is endangered in India (Kolipaka 2011).",,Unknown,"The Caracal is widely distributed across Africa, Central Asia, and south-west Asia into India. While it is relatively common, there is concern over the status of populations on the edge of its range in the Central Asian republics and in Pakistan (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Caracal is widely distributed on the African continent, being absent only from the equatorial forest belt and from much of the central Sahara, but they are present in the montane massifs of that desert and its fringes, including the Hoggar and Tassili mountains of SE Algeria and the Saharan Atlas, the Aïr of Niger, and edges of the great sand areas of Eastern Great Erg Tun and Alg. Their range is continuous to the west and east of the central Sahara, linking the ranges to the south and north of the desert (Stuart and Stuart 2013). The historical range of the Caracal mirrors that of the cheetah, and both coincide with the distribution of several small desert gazelles (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Caracals still occupy much of their historic range in Africa but have experienced substantial loss at the peripheries, particularly in north and west Africa (Ray et al</em>. 2005). Camera trap pictures from 2012 provided evidence of the Caracal in the Mbari Drainage Basin, Chinko, Central African Republic (Hickisch and Aebischer 2013).<br/><br/>In Yemen, the Caracal has been recorded in the south and more recently from Mahra (eastern border). In Oman, it occurs in Dhofar, Jiddat al Harasis, Hajar mountains and Musandam and in Saudi Arabia in the mountains of the southwest and in Harrat al Harrah (Mallon and Budd 2011). In the United Arab Emirates the Caracal is found in wadis in the northern mountains (Mallon and Budd 2011). In Iran, Abbasabad is thought to be one of the best habitats for the species. It is mostly detected in desert mountains and hilly terrains (Farhadinia et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>2008).<br/><br/>In Turkey, the Caracal has been surveyed (Avgan 2011) and photographed Albayrak et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012) at Beydagları Mountains, as well as on the Datça Peninsula (Ilemin and Gürkan 2010). In Afghanistan, the Caracal was recorded in Sare Pul of Jozjan province, the northern steppes, Hari Rud, Murghab and in Amu Darya (Turkestan) (Habibi 2004). In Turkmenistan, Caracals were recently recorded in the Badhyz State Nature Reserve (Kaczensky and Linnell 2014). In India, the Caracal is only found in patches in the dry western region (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004).",,Terrestrial,"Populations in Asian range states are included in CITES Appendix I; populations in African range states are included on Appendix II. Hunting of the species is prohibited in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan (updated from Nowell and Jackson 1996). In sub-Saharan Africa, the Caracal is protected from hunting in about half of its range states (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Namibia and South Africa, the Caracal is classified as a Problem Animal, which permits landowners to kill the species without restriction; nonetheless, Caracals have persisted and remain widespread.<br/><br/>The Caracal is legally protected in all range countries on the Arabian Peninsula. In Oman, the Caracal is included into the National Red Data Book. (Mallon and Budd 2011). <br/><br/>Caracal is present in many large, and well-managed protected areas, across their vast range. Beside others, it is recorded in the Serengeti National Park, from the border of the Ikorongo and Grumeti Game Reserve, Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Manyara National Park, Tarangire National Park, Katavi and Ruaha National Parks and Udzungwa Mountains National Park, Tanzania (TAWIRI 2009). It is found in Dana in Jordan, Arabian Oryx Sanctuary and Jebel Samhan in Oman, in Harrat Al Harrah, Rayda and Shada in Saudi Arabia as well as in Jebel Bura’a, Hawf and Otamah in Yemen (Mallon and Budd 2011, Khorozyan et al.</em> 2014). Captive breeding populations exist in Al Ain Wildlife Park and Resort, the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife in United Arab Emirates and Riyadh Zoo in Saudi Arabia (Mallon and Budd 2011). It is found in the Termessos National Park, Turkey (Giannatos et al.</em> 2006, Albayrak et al.</em> </em>2012) and in the Badhyz State Nature Reserve, Turkmenistan (Kaczensky and Linnell 2014). Caracal was recorded in Bahram’gur Protected Area, Siah-kuh protected area and Kavir National Park, Iran (Ghoddousi et al.</em></em> 2009, Hassan-Beigi et al.</em></em> 2014). Caracal is a protected species according to the Iranian Department of Environment and their hunting is prohibited /Ghoddousi et al.</em> 2010). Caracal was also recorded in the Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve and Sariska Tiger Reserve, western India (Singh et al.</em></em> 2014). According to Kolipaka (2011) there are Caracal sightings from the Melaghat National Park, Maharashtra and from the Bagdara Sanctuary.<br/><br/>As the Caracal may is close to extinction in India, it is important to determine its distribution, abundance and status in the country (Singh et al.</em> </em>2014).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
112910221,4037,Catopuma badia,Endangered,C1,2016,2014-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Borneo Bay Cat, a Bornean endemic, remains one of the least known and infrequently recorded of the world’s wild cats, hindering efforts to assess its conservation needs and status. Historical records, incidental observations, and more recently, camera trap photographic captures and a niche modelling exercise (Hearn et al.</em></em> submitted) indicate that this elusive felid appears restricted to natural and semi-natural forest cover but, within such habitat, exhibits some degree of habitat plasticity. Importantly, however, the extensive areas of swamp forest and oil palm plantations on Borneo do not appear to be used by this felid. A Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based habitat suitability analysis, using presence-only data coupled with expert opinion, estimated that the Bay Cat’s current area of occupancy (AOO) extends to approximately 221,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Borneo Carnivore Symposium 2011, Hearn et al.</em></em> submitted). Due to a lack of sufficient data, this analysis was unable to account for the potential impacts of differential hunting pressure on population density throughout this range. Hunting could plausibly be having a considerable impact on the species and our distribution estimate may, therefore, represent an optimistic estimation of the current AOO. A GIS exercise as part of the current assessment used the habitat suitability assessment alongside landcover data for Borneo for the years 2000 and 2010 (Miettinen et al.</em></em> 2010) and showed that the estimated AOO decreased by 29.8% during this time period, primarily as a result of forest loss and conversion to oil palm. More recent satellite imagery shows that forest loss has continued to reduce the AOO in size (Gaveau et al.</em></em> 2014), and it is likely that forest loss continues to this day, albeit at a reduced rate. In addition, some protected areas in Borneo are small, fragmented and isolated making them vulnerable to climate change and ineffective in conserving low-density species such as the bay cat (Scriven et al.</em></em> 2015). Because the species spends time on the ground, Bay Cats are prone to untargeted snaring and there is increasing evidence for the capture and export of Bay Cats for the illegal pet market. We estimate that the cumulative reduction in the population size as a consequence of degradation, poaching amounts and forest conversion, to between 20-30% in the past 12 years (two Bay Cat generations, Pacifici et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>No population density estimates exist for this felid. Nevertheless, the paucity of Bay Cat specimens collected during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries caused earlier authors to conclude that the species is naturally rare, a stance further bolstered by recent camera survey efforts. Indeed, photographic capture rates of the Bay Cat are substantially lower than that of the sympatric Sunda Clouded Leopard (Neofelis diardi</em>), which is estimated to exist at low densities (1-4 individuals 100 km<sup>2</sup>: Brodie and Giordano 2012a, Wilting et al.</em></em> 2012, Sollmann et al.</em></em> 2014, Loken et al.</em></em> unpublished data) leading some authors to hypothesize that the Bay Cat is found at even lower densities (Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Mohamed et al.</em></em> 2009, Ross et al.</em></em> 2010, but see Wearn et al.</em></em> 2013). Acknowledging that our estimate of current AOO may be biased high as a result of unmeasured hunting pressure and a patchy distribution, we take a precautionary approach and estimate that the mean density of the Bay Cat across the AOO may be as low as one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Extrapolation of this estimate to the wider AOO suggests that the number of mature individuals could plausibly be fewer than 2,500 individuals indicating, in combination with the estimated past decline rate (&gt;30% in the past 12 years), a categorization of Endangered under EN C1.","The Borneo Bay Cat appears to be forest dependent, with records from hill and lowland forest as well as swamp forest (Meijaard 1997, Azlan et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Hearn 2003, Bricknell 2003, Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Yasuda et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Sastramidjaja et al.</em></em></em> in press, Hearn et al.</em></em></em> submitted). It has been recorded from selectively logged forest of various levels of disturbance (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Kitchener et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Meijaard et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Ross et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Hon 2011, Wearn et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Mathai et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Sastramidjaja et al.</em></em></em> in press, Hearn et al.</em></em></em> unpublished data), but was estimated to occur at lower local abundance in logged forests than in unlogged forest (Brodie et al.</em></em></em> 2015). It was not recorded during an intensive, felid-focused camera trap survey of oil palm plantations in Sabah (Ross et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Yue et al.</em></em></em> in press). It has never been the focus of any ecological study and there is no information about its diet (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). It occurs in both a reddish and grey colour phase. The bay cat appears to be primarily diurnal in nature, although not strictly so (Ross et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Nothing is known regarding the spatial ecology of this felid.","Habitat loss due to commercial logging and conversion to oil palm plantations pose the greatest threat to the Bay Cat. Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels, and forest cover on the island of Borneo, if current deforestation rates continue, is projected to decline from 50% to less than one-third by 2020 (Rautner et al.</em></em> 2005). Poaching, particularly the use of snares, poses a significant threat. Wildlife traders are aware of the species' rarity, and Bay Cats have been captured illegally from the wild for the skin and pet markets (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Kitchener et al.</em></em> 2004, Azlan and Sanderson 2007).","There are no population density estimates for the Borneo Bay Cat in any part of its range, yet this elusive felid has long been considered uncommon. Noting the paucity of specimens collected during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, earlier authors concluded that the species was naturally rare. Even now, the Bay Cat is known from only 12 specimens (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Kitchener et al</em>. 2004), and incidental observations remain few and far between (Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Meijaard et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005). Since the advent of intensive camera trap surveys, however, many of them targeted at felids, there has been a slow but steady rise in the number of photographic captures of this felid (Azlan et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003, Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Yasuda 2007, Mohamed et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Wearn et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Gardner et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Sastramidjaja et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Hearn et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data). Nevertheless, even intensive felid focused camera trap surveys yield very few photographs, and photographic capture rates of the bay cat are substantially lower than that of the sympatric Sunda Clouded Leopard (Neofelis diardi</em>), which is estimated to exist at low densities (1-4 individuals 100 km<sup>2</sup>: Brodie and Giordano 2012a, Wilting et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Sollmann et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Loken et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data). Such observations have led some authors to hypothesise that the Bay Cat is found at even lower densities (Azlan and Sanderson 2007, Mohamed et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). It is unclear, however, whether this apparent lower detection rate is a reflection of true rarity or due to underlying factors that result in its elusiveness. Wearn et al.</em></em></em></em>, (2013) compared photo-capture rates of Bay Cats from a number of studies in Borneo and showed that random placement of cameras can result in higher rates than that derived from targeted placement (trails, ridgelines, and logging roads), as is typical of camera trap surveys. Wearn et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013) suggested that the relative abundance of the bay cat may have hitherto been underestimated due to an underlying bias as a result of the use of non-random survey locations coupled with this felid’s particular use of space. A comparison of photo-capture rates between a randomised and a targeted survey of the Tawau Hills National Park in Sabah, however, found no evidence of elevated capture rates of this felid as a result of randomised camera deployment, and instead showed that a randomised survey approach reduced detection probability of all Bornean felids (Hearn et al.</em></em></em> </em>unpublished data).<br/><br/>It is important to highlight that while the increasing use of camera traps across the island of Borneo is slowly yielding more detections of this elusive cat, several intensive, felid-focused camera trap surveys have failed to detect this species (e.g., Tangkulap Forest Reserve, Segaliud Lokan Forest Reserve: Wilting et al.</em></em></em></em> unpublished data, Sepilok Forest Reserve: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data, numerous surveys in Kalimantan: Cheyne and Macdonald, unpublished data), despite a habitat suitability analysis (Bornean Carnivore Symposium, Hearn et al.</em></em></em></em> submitted) predicting the cat to be present. Our estimate of the Bay Cat’s current area of occupancy (AOO) must consequently be viewed with caution.<br/><br/>Although further research is needed to draw more firm conclusions regarding the abundance and distribution of the Borno Bay Cat, the assessors have chosen to follow a precautionary approach, and estimate that the mean density of the Bay Cat throughout its area of occupancy (AOO) is around one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Extrapolation of this density to the estimated AOO suggests the population is plausibly around 2,200 mature individuals.",,Decreasing,"The Borneo Bay Cat is endemic to the island of Borneo, and until recently, its distribution was poorly understood. Although somewhat hindered by the low number of Bay Cat records, Meijaard (1997) collated historical records and contemporary observations of the Bay Cat and speculated that this felid was, and possibly still is, widely distributed on Borneo, a proposition later supported by Azlan and Sanderson (2007). Bolstered by the increasing number of Bay Cat records obtained from chance sightings (Bricknell 2003, Hearn 2003, Meijaard et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005) and the increasing, but still relatively few camera trap records (Azlan et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Yasuda 2007, Mohamed et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Wearn et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Sastramidjaja et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press, Hearn et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> unpublished data), a MaxEnt habitat suitability modelling approach was developed during the Borneo Carnivore symposium in 2011 from presence-only and expert opinion data in combination with environmental and landuse covariates to make predictions regarding the current distribution of Bay Cats (Hearn et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> submitted). In support of Meijaard (1997), Hearn et al.</em></em>’s (submitted) model predicted that an extensive, contiguous, forested area of interior Borneo, in addition to a number of more isolated forested fragments, amounting to approximately 221,000 km<sup>2</sup>, may be currently occupied by the Bay Cat. Due to a lack of data, the habitat suitability exercise was unable to account for the potential impact of differential hunting pressure throughout this range, which potentially could be having a considerable impact, and our estimate may therefore represent an overly optimistic estimation of the current area of occupancy (AOO). Recent records of the Bay Cat stem from the Malaysian states of Sabah (Kitchener et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Mohamed et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ross et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Wearn et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hearn et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> unpublished data) and Sarawak (Dinets 2003, Azlan et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Hon 2011, Brodie and Giordano 2012b, Mathai et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), the Indonesian provinces of East (Yasuda et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Sastramidjaja et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press), West (Hearn 2003, Meijaard et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005), and Central (Bricknell 2003) Kalimantan, and Brunei (J. Sanderson pers. comm.). No records of the Bay Cat have been made in South Kalimantan, yet it is unknown whether this represents a genuine absence or a lack of sufficient sampling effort.<br/><br/>The map presented as part of this assessment is largely based on this habitat suitability exercise, but small patches which were identified as non-habitat in the model output have been included here as habitat. In addition, the Tabin Wildlife Reserve, not included in the original model output, has been included here, based on recorded presence (Ross et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Gardner et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Most Bay Cat records are from below 800 m but Brodie and Giordano (2012b) describe two records from above 1,400 m in the Kelabit Highlands and Payne et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (1985) mention an unconfirmed record from 1,800 m on Mt. Kinabalu.","Bay Cats have  been captured illegally from the wild for the skin and pet markets  (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Kitchener et al.</em></em> 2004, Azlan and Sanderson 2007).",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II (as Catopuma badia</em>). It is fully protected by national legislation across most of its range. Hunting and trade are prohibited in Indonesia (Kalimantan) and Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) (Nowell and Jackson 1996).

The Bay Cat remains to be one of the least studied of the world’s wild cats (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Brodie 2009), hampering the development of conservation actions. It is therefore essential to gain an understanding of this species’ distribution, abundance, and response to anthropogenic modification of its habitat in order to better understand it’s conservation status.

97165437,4038,Catopuma temminckii,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Asiatic Golden Cat is assessed as Near Threatened. However, there is a general paucity of data for this species, with no density estimates or population data, making an assessment of the true status of the species difficult. The data that we do have indicate that the species has likely experienced population declines of over 20%, and approaching 30% in recent years due to extensive habitat loss and poaching across their range. This pattern is likely to continue in the future, and indicates that the Asiatic Golden Cat is very close to qualifying for a Vulnerable status under criterion A.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat has been documented from twelve countries in Southeast Asia. Yet, despite this fairly wide distribution, its presence in India, Bangladesh and Nepal is limited and patchy (Datta et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm.). It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, with records in both China and Viet Nam declining drastically in recent years (Duckworth et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007; Gray et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm.). It has not been recorded in Viet Nam since 2005, and extensive surveys carried out&#160; in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi Provinces of China have recorded Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Wilcox et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Beijing Forestry University unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration unpublished data). It is likely to be extirpated from these two countries in the very near future. The Asiatic Golden Cat is distributed more widely throughout Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, but the is thought to be experiencing population declines in these areas as well (Linkie and Ridout 2009, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015, K. Kawanishi pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm).<br/><br/>The most significant threats to the Asiatic Golden Cat are thought to be habitat loss and poaching. Although the species has occasionally been recorded from degraded or altered habitats, it is primarily a forest dependent species, and thus is threatened by the significant habitat loss and fragmentation throughout its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Holden 2001, Grassman et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed slightly, they are still among the highest in the world at roughly one million hectares/year between 2000 and 2010 (FAO 2011). Land conversion is also a threat to the Asiatic Golden Cat, and even in countries such as Bhutan, where the species is thought to enjoy a relatively protected status, an increase in hyrdopower projects has the potential to negatively impact the species. Poaching of the species is thought to be increasing in many areas, as it is often targeted for the sale of its pelt and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1999, Lynam et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Khan 2008, Aiyadurai et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Pusparini et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014, H. Rahman&#160;pers. comm., P. Riordan&#160;pers. comm., S. Mukherjee&#160;pers. comm., T. Gray&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm., A. Datta&#160;pers. comm., D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Increasingly, the species may be targeted as a substitute for Tiger pelts and bones. In Viet Nam, there have been several incidences of confiscated Asiatic Golden Cat pelts that were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). It is also the victim of indiscriminate snaring and hunting in some areas (Holden 2001, Khan 2008, D. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.). Finally, there are indications that the species is increasingly being killed in retribution for preying on livestock (mainly poultry) (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The lack of reliable density estimates severely limit our ability to accurately assess the population status and trend of the species. However, the decrease, or sudden absence, of Asiatic Golden Cat records from many areas, in combination with an apparently increased level of poaching, lead us to believe that the population is declining across its range. More rigorous scientific data for this species is needed, and may provide a strong basis on which to base change in status to Vulnerable.","The Asiatic Golden Cat is primarily found in forested areas, particularly tropical and subtropical moist evergreen forests, mixed evergreen forests, and dry deciduous forests. (Nowell and Jackson 1996, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy et al.</em></em> 2015). Two radio collared individuals (a male and a female) in Thailand occurred most often in closed forest habitats (Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005). However, the species has also been recorded from open areas such as shrub or grasslands, or open rocky areas, and from degraded or fragmented forest landscapes (Duckworth et al.</em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005, Choudhury 2007, Wang 2007, McCarthy 2013). A radio collared female in Sumatra was frequently recorded outside of a protected area in remnant fragments of forest located between coffee plantations (McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>Records of the Asiatic Golden Cat have a wide altitudinal variation. The species was documented at elevations up to 3,960 m in the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve Sikkim, India, at 3,738 m in the Jigme Sigye Wangchuk National Park in Bhutan, at 2,896 m in Trongsa, and at 3,900 m in Wangduephodrang (Wang 2007, Bashir et al.</em></em> 2011, S. Dahal pers. comm.). However, in some areas it appears to be more common in lowland forests. In Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra, it was only recorded by camera traps at low elevations.<br/><br/>The Asiatic Golden Cat is remarkably polymorphic in its pelage. The most common coat color is golden or red brown, but it may also be dark brown or even grey. Melanistic individuals have been reported and may be predominant in some areas of its range (Holden 2001). There is also a spotted form which is called an “ocelot morph” due to its ocelot-like rosettes. To date, this form has been reported from China (in Sichuan and Tibet) and from Bhutan (Wang 2007). The most distinct features of this cat are the white lines bordered with dark brown to black running across the cheeks, from the nostrils towards the cheeks, at the inner corner of the eyes, and up the crown. The rounded ears have black backs with a grey spot. The chest, abdomen and inner side of the upper legs are white with light speckling. The legs and tail are grey to black at the distal ends. The terminal half of the tail is white on the underside and is often carried with the end curled dorsally. Males are larger than females.<br/><br/>Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of the Asiatic Golden Cat. It was once thought to be primarily nocturnal, however, recent data indicates that it may be more crepuscular or diurnal. Two radio-collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park showed mainly diurnal and crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005). In addition, most camera trap photographs of Asiatic Golden Cats in the Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks in Sumatra were taken during the day (Holden 2001, McCarthy 2013).<br/><br/>The home ranges of two radio collared Golden Cats in Thailand’s Phu Khieu National Park were 33 km² (female) and 48 km² (male) and overlapped in significantly (Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>One confirmed scat contained the remains of Indochinese Ground Squirrel (Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005). Scats from Sumatra contained rat and muntjac remains, and the stomach contents of a carcass in Thailand's Kaeng Krachan National Park included the remains of a small snake (Grassman 1998).","As a forest dependent species, the Asiatic Golden Cat is threatened by habitat loss throughout it's range. Although deforestation rates in Southeast Asia have slowed substantially, they are still among the highest in the world (FAO 2011). An increasing number of hydropower projects in countries such as Bhutan, also have the potential to negatively impact the species. In addition, the species is threatened by increasing levels of illegal hunting and poaching for consumption, and for the sale of pelts and body parts (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth et al.</em> 1999, Lynam et al.</em> 2006, Khan 2008, H. Rahman pers. comm., P. Riordan pers. comm., S. Mukherjee pers. comm., T. Gray pers. comm., S. Dahal pers. comm.). There is thought to be some level of poaching or hunting of the species in every country across its range. Pelts have been recorded being traded along the Myanmar-Thailand border, and in Sumatra (Duckworth et al.</em> 1999, Pusparini et al.</em> 2014), and skins are reported from several sites in northeast India (Aiyadurai et al.</em> 2010, A. Datta pers. comm.). Poaching pressure is particularly high in China and Viet Nam, where the species may soon face extirpation.  In Viet Nam, there is some evidence that the species is increasingly targeted as a substitute for Tiger skins and parts, as Tigers become more difficult to obtain. There have been several incidences of confiscated Golden Cat pelts which were painted to resemble that of a Tiger (D. Willcox pers. comm.). Snaring appears to be on the rise across much of mainland Southeast Asia, and constitutes a major threat to the species D. Willcox pers. comm.). In Bangladesh, several recent specimens indicate that the species is  commonly hunted by indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Conflict with humans due to livestock depredation is also thought to be an issue for the species. Retribution killing of the species in response to chicken depredation was recorded in Sumatra (McCarthy 2013).","A lack of density estimates across the range makes it difficult to accurately assess the true population status of the species. Owing to somewhat similar camera trap encounter rates, the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to have comparable abundances to those of sympatric felids (e.g. Neofelis nebulosa, Neofelis diardi, Pardofelis marmorata</em>). However, some surveys have recorded the Golden Cat more frequently than sympatric felid species, while others have recorded the it less frequently, so their relative abundance likely varies significantly across their range (Holden 2001, Duckworth et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Rao et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Lynam et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Mishra et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, Bashir et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Sunarto 2012, McCarthy 2013, McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In addition, it is important to consider that the Asiatic Golden Cat is thought to be mainly terrestrial, which may influence the number of camera trap photos recorded in comparison to more arboreal felid species such as Neofelis diardi</em>, Neofelis nebulosa</em>&#160;and Pardofelis marmorata</em>.",,Decreasing,"The Asiatic Golden Cat has been recorded rarely and patchily from the Northeastern states of India (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim), through eastern Bangladesh (Northeast and the Chittagong Hill Tracts) and eastern Nepal (Datta et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Khan 2008, Ghimrey and Pal 2009, Bashir et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lyngdoh et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Lalthanpuia et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Borah et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Velho 2013, H.

It is reported infrequently from eastern Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and south China, and records in Viet Nam and south China have decreased drastically in recent years, with strong indications that the species may face extirpation there in the next several years (Duckworth et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1999; Johnson et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006; Gray et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;2014; Wilcox et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014; P.

Kawanishi&#160;pers. comm., S. Dahal&#160;pers. comm.).

In Viet Nam there have been several Asiatic Golden Cat pelts confiscated recently in local markets, however, they are of undetermined origin. A live individual has not been recorded in the country since 2005, despite numerous camera trap studies. It is likely that the species has been extirpated from most of the country due to widespread and indiscriminate snaring. In China, extensive surveys carried out with local protected area and provincial government teams in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces have recorded the Asiatic Golden Cat on only three occasions (Beijing Forestry University, unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration, unpublished data).

This is a rare, small cat occurring in a remote area. Information about this species is relatively sparse and potentially out of date. No substantive advancements in knowledge about the species status and distribution have been made since the previous Red List assessment (Sanderson et al.</em> 2010). Recent camera trapping, sign surveys and local community interviews within the anticipate Chinese Mountain Cat range (Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang), including the Second National Assessment on Wildlife Resources of China, have failed to reveal evidence of the species (Beijing Forestry University, unpublished data, Chinese State Forestry Administration, unpublished data). There is therefore an urgent need for surveys of extant wild populations to be carried out.<br/><br/>The taxonomy of the species remains unclear.

The population is distributed over a wide area and there is a high likelihood of fragmentation, with subpopulations unlikely to contain more than 1,000 mature individuals. The population is considered to be probably declining given the continued threats, lack of protection and the apparent scarcity in surveyed areas.","Little is known, but records suggest that the species occurs in various habitats in mountainous areas, including forests, grasslands and steppe.

50651463,8540,Felis chaus,Least Concern,,2016,2014-06-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Jungle Cat remains probably the most common cat species in South Asia (India, Nepal, Bangladesh), where the majority of the global population occurs and despite likely extensive declines in mainland Southeast Asia, where the species is now extremely scarce and largely restricted to remote lowland deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth et al.</em></em> 2005, Gray et al.</em></em> 2014), it is unlikely that globally averaged declines are sufficient to merit Near Threatened status. Population declines and range contraction are also of concern elsewhere in the species’ range particularly in Egypt (Glas 2013), southwest Asia (Abu-Baker et al.</em></em> 2003), the Caucasus (IUCN 2007), central Asia (Habibi 2004) and parts of Turkey (Ogurlu et al</em>. 2010). However, very little new information has been obtained from these regions since the previous assessment. Nevertheless,<strong> </strong>ongoing collation of records, particularly from South Asia, is needed and evidence of declines, particularly outside protected areas may merit reassessment.<br/><br/>In India, there is evidence of continued, and likely accelerating, habitat loss and ongoing poaching for both skins and, potentially, as a result of conflict with farmers (Choudhury 2010, Chowdhury et al.</em> </em>2015, S. Mukherjee in litt. 2014, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014, D. Jathana in litt. 2014). The Jungle Cat's preference for open scrub and grassland in South Asia makes the species more susceptible to habitat loss than cat species which also utilise denser evergreen forests.<br/><br/>The majority of the suitable Indian habitat is classified as ‘wasteland’ which legally eases conversion into any other form of use particularly industrialisation and urbanization – the latter has been identified as a particular threat in India given the pace of urbanisation of agricultural and unprotected forest areas (S. Mukherjee in litt. 2014, D. Jathana in litt. 2014). Hybridisation with domestic cats is also a potential, although unproven, threat. There remains uncertainty as to how the species will respond to habitat loss, and potential interactions with hunting and persecution. Therefore, further research is recommended, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, in order to gather additional data for a more thorough future assessment of the species' likely trends in response to habitat loss. Generally, more information on the species' ecology and status is needed across its range.","The Jungle Cat, despite its name, is not strongly associated with the classic rainforest ""jungle"" habitat, but rather with wetlands - habitats with water and dense vegetative cover, especially reed swamps, marsh, and littoral and riparian environments - scrubland, and deciduous dipterocarp forest (Gray et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Water and dense ground cover can be found in a variety of habitats, ranging from desert (where it is found near oases or along riverbeds) to grassland, shrubby woodland and dry deciduous forest, as well as cleared areas in moist forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Areas with extensive deciduous dipterocarp forest and at least scattered surface water are the species predominant known habitat in Indochina. However, areas such as the Nakai Plateau which support other forms of savanna-like vegetation may support the species. It is probably absent from all closed canopy forests, including rainforest. The species may make use of agricultural areas with a low intensity of human use and which retain patches of scrub (Duckworth et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2005).&#160;In Iran, the Jungle Cat was found in a variety of habitats such as from plains, agriculture lands and mountains but was mostly found in shrub lands and woodlands (Sanei&#160;et al.</em></em></em>&#160;</em>2016). In&#160;the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation), the favourite habitat of it was reed thickets, thorn bush thickets and thick lowland forests near water bodies (Yarovenko 2014).&#160;An analysis of habitat preferences, from camera-trap photographs, in eastern Cambodia demonstrated a strong preference for deciduous dipterocarp forests with no encounters (c.f. Leopard cat) in other forest types (Gray&#160;et al.</em></em></em></em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Jungle cats have adapted well to irrigated cultivation, having been observed in many different types of agricultural and forest plantations throughout their range, such as sugar cane plantations in India.  In Israel, they can be found around pisciculture ponds and irrigation ditches.  Vereschagin (1959) noted that the Jungle Cat's use of the semi-arid plains of Azerbaijan increased with the development of a local irrigation system and decreased with its abandonment.  However, mowing the seasonally flooded riverine tugai vegetation (trees and shrubs with dense stands of tall reeds and grasses) of this region for livestock fodder, as well as ploughing it under for agriculture, is known to be associated with the decline of Jungle Cat populations in the European-central Asian parts of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>In India, in a study in the Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, the Jungle Cat was mostly active in the night hours (Majumder et al.</em></em></em> </em>2011), whereas in Cambodia, Jungle Cats were found to be more active during the day (Gray et al.</em></em></em> </em>2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Jungle Cats feed mainly on prey that weighs less than one kilogram.  Small mammals, principally rodents,  are the prey most frequently found in feces and stomach contents (Adhya 2014, Majumder et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). A study in India's Sariska reserve estimated that Jungle Cats catch and eat three to five rodent per day (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004).  Birds rank second in importance, but in southern Russia waterfowl are the mainstay of Jungle Cat diet in the winter.  With overwintering populations of waterfowl congretating in large numbers on unfrozen rivers and marshes, the Jungle Cat hunts among reed beds and along edges of wetlands, searching for injured or weakened birds.  Other prey species are taken more opportunistically, including hares, nutria, lizards, snakes, frogs, insects, and fish (Majumder et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Ogurlu et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Sunquist and Sunquist 2002,&#160;Patel 2011). In India, they have been seen to scavenge kills of large predators such as the Asiatic lion.  In a study in southern Uzbekistan, the fruits of the Russian olive made up 17% of their diet in winter.  While Jungle Cats specialize on small prey, they are large and powerful enough to kill young swine, subadult gazelles, and chital fawns (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Density estimates from natural tugai habitat in central Asia range from 4-15 individuals per 10 km², but where this vegetation type has declined due to development density it does not exceed 2 cats per 10 km² (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","The biggest threat to Jungle Cat is habitat loss&#160;particularly industrialisation and urbanisation of low intensity agricultural areas and scrubland in the Indian subcontinent. Habitat destruction for agricultural purposes and infrastructure development are also issues in Turkey and Iran (Ogurlu et al.</em></em> </em>2010, Sanei et al.</em></em></em> 2016). In Turkey, wetlands are mainly threatened by dam constructions and irrigation projects (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014). Additionally, environmental pollution and illegal hunting are threatening the Jungle Cat in Turkey too (Ogurlu et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Also in Iran, illegal killing of Jungle Cats by shooting or trapping is a threat (Sanei et al.</em></em> </em>2016). Jungle cats can do well in cultivated landscapes (especially those that lead to increased numbers of rodents) and artificial wetlands. However, reclamation and destruction of natural wetlands, ongoing throughout its range but particularly in the arid areas, still pose a threat to the species, as density in natural wetlands is generally higher (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Nevertheless, the species' response to urbanisation and degradation of low intensity agricultural landscapes is unclear and merits further research.<br/><br/>Unselective trapping, snaring and poisoning around agricultural and settled areas have caused population declines in many areas throughout its range (Abu-Baker et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Duckworth et al.</em></em></em> 2005).  India formerly exported large numbers of Jungle Cat skins before the species came under legal protection (over 300,000 were declared as being held by traders there when export was banned in 1979), and some illegal trade (and killing) continues there (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010), elsewhere in South Asia (Chowdhury et al.</em></em></em> 2015, H.S. Baral in litt. 2014) as well as in Egypt (Glas 2013) and Afghanistan (Habibi 2004). The scarcity of Jungle Cat in mainland Southeast Asia is likely the result of high levels of hunting in open and accessible deciduous dipterocarp forest (Duckworth et al.</em></em></em> 2005).","In Europe, the Jungle Cat is of marginal occurrence, with small populations in Cis-Caspian region and the Caucasus along the Caspian Sea. The European population has been rapidly declining since the 1960s. There was no records of this species in Astrakhan State Reserve (Russian Federation) since the 1980s. In Northern Ossetia (Russian Federation) only about 150 animals were recorded (Kuryatnikov and Varziev 1983).&#160;In the Republic of Dagestan (Russian Federation), the number of Jungle Cats was estimated at 105 animals in 2009, at 216 in 2010, at 177 in 2011, at 110 in 2012 and at 307 animals in 2013, showing population fluctuations (Yarovenko 2014).&#160;Marked population fluctuations are characteristic of this species in this region, probably because of absence of adaptations to cold winters. Despite these fluctuations the long-term trend in Europe is of decline in both population and area of occupancy. Data from Russia suggest that there are about 500 animals left in the wild (Prisazhnyuk and Belousova 2007). A very small population persists in Georgia (I. Macharashvili pers. comm. to K. Tsysulina 2007). This species is considered threatened in a number of range states in Europe and the Caucasus, and is included in the Red Books of the Russian Federation, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia (IUCN 2007). In southwest Asia the species is considered rare and threatened (Abu-Baker&#160;et al</em>. 2003, Habibi 2004). However, the Jungle Cat is considered common in some parts of its range, primarily in India (Mukherjee 1998, Patel 2011), but also in Pakistan and Bangladesh (Duckworth et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2005). Nevertheless, in southern China and southeast Asia, it appears quite rare in comparison to sympatric small cats (Duckworth et al</em>. 2005).  This rarity appears to be a relatively recent phenomenon associated with unselective trapping and snaring, especially in Lao PDR and Thailand as well, where it was described as common by Lekagul and McNeely (1977) but has since suffered drastic declines and is rarely encountered (Duckworth et al</em>. 2005, Lynam et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). There are a number of recent camera-trap records from the Eastern Plains Landscape protected area complex in eastern Cambodia (Gray et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014) and this area likely remains the stronghold of the species outside South Asia.",,Decreasing,"The Jungle Cat has a broad but patchy distribution.  In Africa, it is found only in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley south to Aswan, and in El Faiyum, Farafara, Dakhla and Kharga oases (Glas 2013). In Southwest Asia its occurrence is highly localized around riparian vegetation and permanent water sources.&#160;It occurs through Israel, southern Lebanon, northwestern Jordan, western Syria, Turkey, Iraq and into Iran where it is found in the north, from the provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran westwards along the Caspain Sea coastline and Hyrcanian forests to the West Azarbaijan Province (Abu-Baker et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2003, Sanei et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).&#160;In Turkey, the Jungle Cat has a fragmented distribution and seems to be quite widely distributed in the south of the country but to be restricted especially to wetland areas (Gerngross 2014). Jungle cat presence was recently recorded around the Büyük Menderes Delta, Aydin Province, in the Akyatan Wildlife Conservation and Development Area, Akyatan Lagoon, Adana Province, and close to Manavgat, Antalya Province (Avgan 2009, Gerngross 2014).&#160;However, its status in Turkey is not known (Avgan 2009). The Jungle Cat is found in the Caucasus mountains (up to 1,000 m) including Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia. It occurs west and south of the Caspian Sea as well as south and east of the Aral Sea and associated river valleys, In Central Asia, it is found in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, possibly Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan. Its distribution extants into South Asia from western Pakistan through&#160;almost all of India as well as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal ranging up to 2,400 m in the Himalayan foothills. The Jungle Cat occurrs through Southeast Asia including Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos PDR and Vietnam, to southern China, but is absent from Malayan peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Its range in Indochina is poorly known, especially in Myanmar.  Duckworth et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2005) reviewed the few historical distribution records from Indochina and added several recent ones from Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam.","Some illegal trade (and killing) continues in India (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Choudhury 2010) and elsewhere in South Asia.",Terrestrial,"The Jungle Cat is listed on CITES Appendix II.  It is protected from hunting in some range states (India), but in many it receives no legal protection outside protected areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species now receives legal protection from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan after being placed on the country’s 2009 Protected Species List. Furthermore, given the amount of habitat loss occurring in riparian and wetland areas in Afghanistan, this species should be considered a research priority.<br/><br/>The ecology and status of the Jungle Cat is poorly known (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Southwest and Southeast Asia, where it is considered rare and declining, more research needs to be undertaken to gain knowledge of current distribution, both in and outside of protected areas (Abu-Baker et al.</em></em> 2003, Duckworth et al.</em></em> 2005).  Some farmers consider the Jungle Cat a pest which takes poultry (Abu-Baker et al.</em></em> 2003), and conservation measures should include better protection for domestic fowl and halting of indiscriminate poisoning and trapping.  The Jungle Cat would also benefit from improved protection of natural wetlands and reedbeds, particularly in the more arid parts of its range, and improved legislation prohibiting fur trade.<br/><br/>The Jungle Cat was recorded in 13 protected areas in Iran (Sanei et al.</em></em>&#160;2016).

50651884,8541,Felis margarita,Least Concern,,2016,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Sand Cat is listed as Least Concern because even though it occurs naturally at low densities, and confirmed records are sparse (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Sliwa 2013), it nonetheless exceeds both the extent of occurrence (EOO; 15,414,561 km²) and area of occupancy (AOO; 940,163 km²) thresholds for listing under B and the total population size (here conservatively estimated at 27,264 mature individuals) is estimated to exceed the threshold for threatened status under criterion C. Although some local declines have been reported, and several threats documented, there is no convincing evidence to support a range-wide decline over three generations that is substantial enough to qualify for Near Threatened or Vulnerable under A. Whether the rarity of the species is caused both in the past and currently by threats such as increasing habitat degradation and loss or the result of natural low density due to low primary productivity as well as difficulty in detection in its habitats is unknown.<br/><br/>Only very limited in-depth ecological research has been conducted since the last assessment in 2008, and the basic ecological needs of the Sand Cat are still poorly understood. Therefore, its distribution, status and the impact of threats on the species are difficult to assess. Moreover, there are still few recent confirmed records across its range (Sliwa 2013), and its extant distribution and population size is not well understood, despite heightened interest and publication of mostly singular sightings. More research needs to be initiated to document present continuous occurrence and assess its status. There are several areas of likely population declines (Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep). Apart from new localized records in both space and time about its presence in a few range countries, no easily measurable changes within its distribution area are apparent, although threats and human induced negative impact on desert ecosystems have rather increased.","The Sand Cat is a specialist of sandy desert, where it is unevenly distributed, localized around sparse vegetation which can support small rodent prey (Novell and Jackson 1996). In Morocco, it was found in sandy areas with perennial grass, low bushes and Acacia trees (Sliwa et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). In Iran, its main habitats are sand dunes with Saxaul Haloxylon trees and arid flat plains with little vegetation (Ghadirian et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016). In the Arabian Peninsula it mainly occurs in sandy habitats but also in areas of hard, rocky substrate, such as gravel plains and volcanic lava fields (Cunningham 2002, Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). It is present in stony desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). With its thickly furred feet, it is well adapted to the extremes of a desert environment, living in areas far from water, and tolerant of extremes of hot and cold temperatures (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Sliwa 2013). It is known to use burrows as resting sites (M. Strauss pers. comm. 2008, M. Sher Shah pers. comm. 2016) and is absent from areas where the soil is compacted (Heptner and Sludskii 1972). In Central Asia the Sand Cat is known to withstand 40° Celsius in summer (80° Celsius on sand surface) and -25° Celsius in winter (Ghadirian et al.</em></em></em> </em>2016). Individuals have been observed to use dens to escape from the sun, that they either dug themselves or adopted form other species like Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes</em> or Porcupines Hystrix </em>sp. (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser 2011, Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). In the Moroccan Sahara, it seems that, in winter, Sand Cats do not use dens but hide amongst rocks or under vegetation during the day (Breton et al.</em></em></em> </em>2016). The Sand Cat appears to be primarily nocturnal (Abbadi 1993, Nowell and Jackson 1996) and in winter also crepuscular (Breton et al.</em></em></em> </em>2016).<br/><br/>Small rodents is its primary prey, with records including Spiny Mice Acomys</em> spp., Jirds Meriones</em> spp., Gerbils Gerbillus</em> spp., and Jerboas Jaculus</em> spp. and Allactaga tetradactyla</em>, but also young of Cape Hare Lepus capensis</em> in Africa. It has also been observed to hunt small birds like Greater Hoopoe Lark Alaemon alaudipes</em>, Desert Lark Ammomanes deserti,</em> and to consume reptiles such as smaller Desert Monitor Varanus griseus</em>, Fringe-toed lizards Acanthodactylus </em>spp., Sandfish Scincus scincus</em>, Short-fingered Gecko Stenodactylus</em> spp., Horned and Sand vipers of the genus Cerastes</em>, and insects (De Smet 1988, Abbadi 1993, Dragesco-Joffé 1993, Cunningham 2002, Sliwa 2013). Sand-dwelling rodents made up the majority (65–88%) of stomach contents from carcasses collected in Turkmenistan and Uzebekistan in the 1960s (Schauenberg 1974). Small mammals preys like Euphrates jerboa Allactaga euphratica</em>, Libyan jird Meriones libycus</em>, Cheesman's gerbil Gerbillus cheesmanni </em>are presumed prey in western Iraq (M.K. Mohammad pers. obs. February 2016). On the Arabian Peninsula the Sand Cat was recorded to prey on Spiny-tailed Lizard Uromastyx aegyptia</em> and Jird Meriones arimalius</em> and may also take locusts when they swarm (Cunningham 2002, Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The Sand Cats' distribution coincides with that of Sand Skink Scincus mitranus </em>and Arabian Toad-head Lizard Phrynocephalus arabicus</em>; both reptiles are thought to be an important source of food for the cat (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). The Sand Cat is capable of rapid digging to reach prey animals underground (Schauenberg 1974). It may cover kills with sand and return later to feed. It is independent of drinking water and capable of satisfying its moisture requirements from prey, but drinks readily if water is available (Sliwa 2013).<br/><br/>Home range sizes will likely vary according to ecological conditions and vegetation availability for prey animals, likely more favorable in suitable habitat of protected areas, where there is no major disturbance through domestic stock grazing. In a study along a dirt road (piste) in southern Morocco, initial home ranges (100% MCP) of two males and one female followed during four to six days were 35.3 km², 21.8 km² and 13.4 km², respectively (Breton et al.</em></em></em> </em>2016). A radio telemetry study in Israel suggests large home ranges, with one male using an area of 16 km² (Abbadi 1993). Seven annual ranges (95% MCP) in the Saja/Umm ar-Rimth reserve, Saudi Arabia, were estimated at 19.6-50.7 km² (mean 35.5 km²) (Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep). Home ranges of males may overlap with each other and there is a considerable overlap between seasonal ranges of males and females (Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep.). Sand Cats have been recorded to move long distances in a single night (5–10 km) (Abbadi 1993). In Morocco, one male travelled more than 14 km in a straight line in less than 30 hours (Breton et al.</em></em></em>&#160;</em>2016). In the Saja / Umm ar-Rimth reserve, the weight of male Sand Cats averaged 2.41 kg (n=13) and that of females 1.82 kg (n=16) (Sher Shah et al.</em></em></em> 2016 in prep.). In Morocco, males (n=2) had a weight of 2.14 and 2.36 kg and females (n=2) of 1.32 and 1.85 kg (Breton et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016).","Habitat degradation and loss for example through fencing (Sher Shah and Cunningham 2008, Banfield et al.</em></em> 2014) are considered to be the major threats to the Sand Cat. Many areas are also more heavily frequented by humans, their domestic animals and commensals (i.e. red fox, Vulpes vulpes</em>). Vulnerable arid ecosystems are being rapidly converted by infrastructural development and human settlement and activity, especially degraded through livestock grazing (Allan and Warren 1993, Al-Sharhan et al.</em></em> 2003, Ghadirian et al.</em></em> 2016). Degradation of desert ecosystems continues to be widely acknowledged as an urgent conservation problem (Bunaian et al.</em></em> 2001, Abahussain et al.</em></em> 2002, Al-Sharhat et al.</em></em> 2003, Mallon and Budd 2011, Sliwa et al.</em></em> 2013) and could result in a decline of Sand Cat populations, caused by a declining prey base. The Sand Cat's small mammal prey base depends on having adequate vegetation, and may experience large fluctuations due to drought (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep), or declines due to desertification and loss of natural vegetation. In the Arabian Peninsula, sand dune habitat continues to decline (Mallon and Budd 2011). Human induced habitat destruction through underground nuclear tests in the late 1990ies in Pakistan, where Sand Cats were recorded in the 1960ies. Several of the areas have been affected by political strife, and war-like conditions that have accelerated habitat destruction. Habitat destruction through civil war i.e. in Syria. In Iraq, the location which the Sand Cat was recorded from (Mohammad et al.</em></em> 2013) falls within the Arabian Desert and East Sahero-Arabian Xeric Shrublands (PA1303) which is considered to be “Critical/Endangered” (Republic of Iraq Ministry of Environment 2010, M. K. Mohammad pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>More recently, additional threats identified are the introduction of feral and domestic dogs and cats, creating direct competition for prey and through predation and disease transmission (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ostrowski et al.</em></em> 2003, Sliwa 2013, Sliwa et al.</em></em> 2013). This applies particularly along roads through suitable habitat (Sliwa et al.</em></em> 2013, Sliwa, pers. obs. 2015). They are also killed in traps laid out by inhabitants of oases targeting Red Fox, Rüppel’s Fox and Golden Wolf (jackal) Canis anthus</em> or in retaliation for killing their chickens or Houbara and MacQueen's bustard Chlamydotis undulata</em> / Ch. macqueenii </em>(De Smet 1989, Dragesco-Joffé 1993). Locally, Sand Cats may be threatened by the pet trade (Banfield et al.</em></em> 2014, P. Cunningham pers. comm. 2016). In Iran, Sand Cats are reported to get killed by shepherd dogs and trapped in snares set for other species (Ghadirian et al.</em></em> 2016). They also get stuck in fences (Sher Shah and Cunningham 2008) and are vulnerable to indiscriminate trapping and poisoning of predators (Mallon and Budd 2011). There are occasional reports of Sand Cats shot in Saudi Arabia (M. Strauss pers. comm. 2008, Cunningham 2009).","There are relatively few records of Sand Cat and the species is often reported as rare (Sliwa 2013). It was recently recorded in isolated areas from where historical records do not exist, such as deserts in Syria, western Saudi Arabia, western Iraq and central Chad (Serra et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Strauss et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Mohammad et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013, M. K. Mohammad, pers. obs. February 2016, Rabeil et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). However, recent records are lacking from several range countries such as from Jordan, Palestine, Qatar and Yemen (Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014), where specific surveys have either not been conducted, or the species has not been detected due to its elusive habits or the species is absent and thus the conservation status of the Sand Cat is unknown there. In Israel, the species has not been recorded in the country on post-2000 surveys and is now considered locally extinct (Noam Leader, Israel Nature and Parks Authority, in litt. 2014).<br/><br/>The only available density estimates come from a telemetry study in southern Israel, where 11 Sand Cats were caught in the study area of 15 x 25 km (375 km²), resulting in an estimated density of 2.9/100 km² (M. Abbadi, in Sliwa 2013). Based on this density and the estimated AOO (based on only the extant species range), the total population is conservatively estimated at 27,264 mature individuals. In the Saja / Umm Ar-Rimth Protected Area, Saudi Arabia, the annual home ranges (95% MCP) of 7 Sand Cats were 19.6 – 50.7 km² (Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep). In the same area Sand Cats appear to occur at far lower densities than Rüppell's Fox Vulpes rueppellii </em>(Strauss et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007 and pers. comm. 2008). Sher Shah recorded 692 Rüppells Foxes in comparison to 62 Sand Cat captured in a total of 4509 trap nights between 2001-2009 (Sher Shah et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016 in prep). Particularly in the years 2006-07 there was heightened mortality in the 5 captured and radio-collared Sand Cats, three (60%) of them dying within a few months and the remaining two recorded missing after making large movements away from their initial home ranges. This 100 % mortality could have been due to the drought conditions the protected areas experienced (Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep, Sher Shah et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016 in prep). This is also reflected by live-trapping in Saja / Umm Ar-Rimth Protected Area, Saudi Arabia where six Sand Cats were caught in a trap grid in 2002 reaching a potential density of 16.66 /100 km² (Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep, Sher Shah et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016 in prep). Subsequent trapping sessions in 2005 with seven Sand Cats caught gave such trapping derived densities at 14.27 / 100 km². The capture rate decreased to 2.83 / 100 km² in 2006 with only one caught. In the years 2007 and 2009 no Sand Cats were caught in the same trapping grid (Sher Shah and Shobrak 2016 in prep, Sher Shah et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016 in prep), documenting a possible local decline. Whether such calculations are valid estimators of densities is open to debate. A certain decline in capture rate could also have been due to trap shyness. In Mahazat As-Sayd Reserve no Sand Cat was seen between 2008 and 2009 (P. Cunningham, pers. comm. 2016). In low-quality habitat, such as shifting sand dunes, densities may be very low (Sliwa 2013). Numbers may fluctuate in response to environmental conditions leading to prey declines and recoveries (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). The Sand Cat population on the Arabian Peninsula is considered to be declining at an unknown rate (Mallon and Budd 2011, Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014), although this is difficult to prove, while in certain areas there may be more Sand Cats than previously expected (T. Wacher, pers. comm. 2016). There are no confirmed records from Yemen. <br/><br/>In the past 10 years (2006-2016) there seem to be repeated and regular reports of Sand Cats from Western Sahara, South Algeria, Niger, Chad, southwestern Saudi Arabia and the border area of southeaster Saudi Arabia with Oman and the United Arab Emirates, and Iran, probably strongholds for the species. This contrasts with the status in Central Asia and Pakistan, which is largely unknown, with only very few recent records available (Burnside et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). The same applies to the Karakum desert in Turkmenistan, with no records within the past 25 years, most of the records being far older (cited in Heptner and Sludskii 1972) and thus at least 5 generations of Sand Cats ago.",,Unknown,"The global distribution of the Sand Cat appears to be markedly patchy. The Sand Cat is the only felid found primarily in true desert, and has a wide (EOO: 15,414,561 km²) but apparently disjunct distribution in the deserts of northern Africa and southwest and central Asia. It is not clear whether the gaps in known range are due to a lack of records or truly reflect species absence (Hemmer et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>1976, Nowell and Jackson 1996). For example, sightings have been reported in Libya and Egypt west of the Nile (Sliwa 2013), but there are no confirmed historical records despite intensive collecting effort in this part of the Sahara (Hemmer et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>1976) and this is unchanged to present.<br/><br/>In north Africa the Sand Cat occurs in former Western Sahara, currently administered by Morocco (records 2012- 2015, Chevalier et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>2012, Webb et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Sliwa et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Chevallier et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Rodríguez-Siles et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, Breton et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016), in Algeria within and close to Ahaggar Cultural Park (Belbachir 2009, F. Belbachir, pers. comm. 2011, sighting was end of December 2010) further two individuals were killed in the Algerian Grand Erg Occidental (K. De Smet, pers. comm. 2014; undated killing) and the Béni Abbès region (R. Tahri, pers. comm. 2016, interview with hunter 2013, but undated killing) and one sighted in 2015 in the Tindouf area (I. Belbali, pers. comm. 2016), in Egypt in the northern Sinai peninsula (Saleh and Basuony 1998) and in 1984 in the rocky deserts of eastern Egypt (Goodman and Helmy 1986). Although there have been alleged sightings, no confirmed records exist from Tunisia, Libya, west of the Nile River in Egypt. There are recent camera-trap and sighting records from Niger and Chad (Rabeil et al</em>. 2016), as well as sighting records from Mali (including a recent night time observation in the Lake Faguibine area: O. Hamerlynck pers. comm. 2011). In Mauritania, it is supposed to occur historically in the Adrar mountains and Majabat al Koubra (Lamarche 1980), however this is again unconfirmed by specimens or photographic records.<br/><br/>In Asia, the sand has been recorded in Syria, around the area of Palmyra (Serra et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>2007). Its presence in Palestina is uncertain. Sand cats were first recorded in Iraq in 2012 in West Al-Najaf desert and from Al Jufaira oasis (Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Mohammad et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). It has been recorded in Iran and east of the Caspian Sea in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, but it is not known if the distribution is or was continuous to the Arabian Peninsula (Hemmer et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>1976, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Uzbekistan, a breeding population of Sand Cats was discovered in 2013 in the Southern Kyzylkum Desert (Burnside et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>2014). There are no recent reports on Sand Cats from Turkmenistan, although there is a report speculating on their continued presence in 1990 in the Karakum desert (Lukarevskiy 2001). In Kazakhstan, the Sand Cat is supposedly found on the Mangyshlak Peninsula, Ustyurt Plateau and the Kyzyl Kum Desert to the Syr Darya River (Institute for Zoology and Gene Pool of Animals of National Academy of Sciences of Republic of Kazakhstan 1996) but dated records are missing. A year-long study in the Kazakh Kysylkum in 2015 failed to find Sand Cats (G. Shakula via J. Sanderson, pers. comm. 2016). In Iran, Sand Cats distribution is limited to the desert habitats in the centre, east and southeast of the country but there are also some records from the north of the country (Farhadinia et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Ghadirian et al</em>. 2016). It is not known if the Sand Cat populations in Pakistan's Balochistan province are connected to the central Asian population via Afghanistan (Habibi 2004) and particularly what their status is after nuclear tests were done in the Nushki desert in the 1990s.<br/><br/>The Sand Cat shows a scattered distribution across the Arabian Peninsula. However, its status and distribution are not well known (Mallon and Budd 2011). The Sand Cat is considered very rare in Jordan and United Arab Emirates (Bunaian et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>2001, Cunningham 2002, Mallon and Budd 2011, Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014) and there are few post 2000 records. Sand Cats have been recorded in Oman from the Empty Quarter and Wahiba Sands (A. Spalton, pers. comm. 2016) and some protected areas in Saudi Arabia (Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Mallon and Budd 2011, Sher Shah and Cunningham 2008, Strauss et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>2007). There are also recent records form a systematic camera-trapping study from the western Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia (T. Wacher pers. comm. 2016), which established a higher occupancy than expected from incidental sightings. Two records in Qatar were published in 1991 (Mallon and Budd 2011) and recent records in Kuwait close to the international borders with Saudi Arabia and Iraq (Banfield et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> </em>2014). Its presence in Qatar is uncertain and there have been no records in Yemen since 1952 (Mallon and Budd 2011) and it is possibly extinct.",,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II. Hunting of this species is prohibited in Algeria, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Niger, Pakistan, Tunisia, and United Arab Emirates (Nowell and Jackson 1996). On the African continent, the Sand Cat inhabits several protected areas, including Tassili n'Ajjer and Ahaggar Cultural Parks (Algeria), Aïr and Ténéré National Reserve (Niger), and possibly Djebel Bou-Hedma Biosphere Reserve (Tunisia) (Sliwa 2013). In Iran, it has been reported from the Abbasabad Naein Reserve, Kavir and Touran National Park (Semnan Province), Shaskooh and Mozaffari protected areas, Siahkooh National Park (Yazd province) and in Moteh and Touran protected areas (Ghadirian et al.</em> </em>2016, Farhadinia et al.</em></em> 2008, Nowell and Jackson 1996). On the Arabian Peninsula, the Sand Cat was recorded in the protected areas of Mahazat As-Sayd (not in 2008/9), Saja/Umm Ar-rimth and Uruq Bani Ma'arid, Harrat al Harrah Reserve (Saudi Arabia), in the Wadi Rum (Jordan), and in Baynunah and Umm Al Zumul Reserves (UAE) (Strauss pers. obs., Mallon and Budd 2011, Banfield et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Captive breeding populations exist in the range countries at Al Wabra (Qatar), The Scientific Centre (Kuwait), Al Ain Zoo, and the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (UAE), Omani Wild Animals Breeding Centre (Oman), Zoological Center Tel Aviv-Ramat Gan, Hai Bar Yotvata NR, I. Meier Segals Garden for Zoological Research, Tel Aviv (Israel). There are also captive breeding populations in the USA and Europe (Breton 2015).<br/><br/>The development of reliable survey methods is urgently needed (Mallon and Budd 2011). Furthermore, studies on the behaviour and ecology of the Sand Cat are crucial to apply appropriate conservation measures.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
177944648,8542,Felis nigripes,Vulnerable,C2a(i),2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This assessment is based on the national Red List assessment for South Africa (Wilson et al.</em> 2016). Black-footed Cats are endemic to the arid regions of southern Africa, occurring widely across the western reaches in a relatively restricted and patchy distribution. The historical paucity of data has led to inconsistencies and perpetuated inaccuracies in current literature, which in turn has affected the accuracy of conservation measures. The naturally rare, cryptic colouring, small size and secretive nocturnal nature of this species has contributed considerably to the lack of information. Black-footed Cats are known to occur at low densities and it is difficult to establish population sizes. The stronghold of the species is suspected to be in the central Karoo region of South Africa where highest densities are reached, whereas other regions are suspected to have medium or low densities. Using density estimates of 0.03 km², 0.02 km² and 0.01 km² for high, medium and low density areas respectively, we converted kernel densities to isopleths to calculate population size. Estimated population size is 13,867 individuals, of which 9,707 are considered to be mature (using a 70% mature population structure), where no subpopulation is suspected to comprise more than 1,000 mature individuals as the species is patchily distributed. However, defining subpopulations for this species needs further work. We also caution that these estimates will be confounded by uneven sampling across the range, thus leading to inaccurate density isopleths. This is a first attempt and should be refined as more data from across the range become available.<br/><br/>There is a general suspected continuing decline due to loss of prey base due to bushmeat poaching (especially Springhare Pedetes capensis</em>), persecution (direct or incidental), road collisions and predation by domestic animals. Continuing decline is also inferred from a long-term study in Benfontein, Northern Cape where estimated density declined from 0.17 cats / km² in 1998–1999 to 0.08 cats / km² in 2005–2015. Additionally, ca</em> 50% of radio-collared individuals are lost annually to a combination of natural mortality and predation from abundant Black-backed Jackals (Canis mesomelas</em>) and Caracals (Caracal caracal</em>). An emerging threat may be increasing interspecific competition, including intraguild predation, by overabundant mesopredators (for example, Black-backed Jackals).<br/><br/>Thus, we list this species as Vulnerable C2a(i), as population size is estimated to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, where no subpopulation is suspected to be more than 1,000 mature individuals, and there is an inferred continuing decline. We note that this is a precautionary assessment given the low density estimates used in the analysis, the lack of systematic field surveys across the range and the lack of a robust subpopulation definition. This species should be reassessed once such data are available. Key interventions include the establishing of large conservancy areas and sustaining viable Springhare subpopulations in areas where alternative refuge systems are unavailable.","The Black-footed Cat is one of the world's smallest cats, with females weighing an average of 1.30 kg and males larger at 1.93 kg (Sliwa 2013). The conspecific and more common African Wildcat (Felis silvestris)</em> is considerably larger (females - 3.9 kg, males - 5.1 kg) (Sliwa et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Unlike most cat species, these cats are predominantly ground-dwellers and will not readily take to trees. They lead a solitary existence except when with kittens or during brief mating periods. Black-footed Cats are extremely secretive in nature. They are strictly crepuscular and nocturnal and are active throughout the night, even hunting at temperatures of -8˚ C (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997). During the day, the cats make use of dens. The species prefers hollowed out abandoned termite mounds when available (especially for the kittens), but will use dens dug by other animals such as Springhares, Ground Squirrels (Xerus inauris</em>) and Aardvark (Orycteropus afer</em>). It is a specialist of open, short grass areas with an abundance of small rodents and ground-roosting birds. It inhabits dry, open savannah, grasslands and Karoo semi-desert with sparse shrub and tree cover and a mean annual rainfall of between 100 and 500 mm at altitudes up to 2,000 m above sea level. It is not found in the driest and sandiest parts of the Namib and Kalahari Deserts (Sliwa 2013).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats mate year round but with a distinct season from late winter (August) over the summer months up to March. Up to two litters a year may be produced, with one to four kittens (normally two) born after 63–68 day gestation inside a Springhare burrow or hollow termitarium (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997, Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Births are timed to coincide with rains and food availability. Kittens are independent after 3–4 months, but remain within the range of their mother for extended periods (Sliwa 2013). Whilst they are reported to live up to 16 years in captive situations, life expectancy in the wild is about five years (Black-footed Cat Working Group unpubl. data), although two monitored individuals lived at least seven years (Sliwa et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>As with most small cat species, Black-footed Cats are obligate carnivores. During a 6-year field study on the game farm in central South Africa, 1,725 prey items were observed consumed by 17 free-ranging habituated individuals (Sliwa 2006). Average prey size was 24.1 g. Eight males fed on significantly larger prey (27.9 g) than 9 females (20.8 g). Fifty-four prey species were classified by their average mass into eight different size classes, three for mammals, three for birds, one for amphibians/reptiles, and one for invertebrates. Small mammals (5–40 g) constituted the most important prey class (39%) of total prey biomass followed by larger mammals (&gt; 100 g, 17%) and small birds (&lt; 40 g, 16%). Mammals and birds pooled comprised 72% and 26% of total prey biomass, respectively, whereas invertebrates and amphibians/reptiles combined constituted just 2% of total prey mass consumed. Heterotherm prey items were unavailable during winter, when larger birds and mammals (&gt; 100 g) were mainly consumed. Small rodents like the Large-eared Mouse (Malacothrix typica</em>), captured 595 times by both sexes, were particularly important during the reproductive season for females with kittens. Males showed less variation between prey size classes consumed among climatic seasons. This sex-specific difference in prey size consumption may help to reduce intra-specific competition (Sliwa 2006). In terms of interspecific competition, Sliwa et al.</em></em></em> (2010) found that Black-footed Cats captured smaller prey on average than African wildcats, although both captured approximately the same number (12–13) of prey animals per night.<br/><br/>Of 17 radio-collared Black-footed Cats (7 males, 10 females) studied at game farm at Benfontein Game Farm, Northern Cape Province from 1997 to 1998, the home ranges of adult resident males averaged 16.1–20.7 km² while those of females were 8.6–10 km², where male home range overlapped with females’ by 60–67% (Sliwa 2004). Despite this overlap, all individuals hunt solitarily. Similarly, annual home range sizes of Black-footed Cats were 7.1 km² for an adult female, and 15.6 and 21.3 km² for two adult males monitored at Benfontein Game Farm, Northern Cape Province from 2006 to 2008 (Kamler et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Since range size is dependent on available prey resources, in more arid regions these home ranges can be considerably larger. Both sexes spray mark, particularly during mating season when they are deployed in proportion to intensity of use and may play a role in social spacing (Molteno et al.</em></em></em> 1998, Sliwa et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Adults travel an average of 8.42±2.09 km per night – more distance than the African Wildcat (5.1±3.4 km per night) despite their smaller size (Sliwa et al.</em></em></em> 2010).","Following 22 years of research effort by the Black-footed Cat Working Group, the threats to the species have become more apparent (Wilson 2016). Additional and previously unknown threats including, but not limited to, intraguild predation, diseases, declining Springhare populations and unsuitable farming practices have now been realised. All of these suggest that the species is becomingly increasingly threatened. New distribution data clearly indicate that the majority of the distribution occurs outside of formally protected areas (Figure 1 in&#160;Supporting Material). Indeed, the majority of protected areas are suspected to be too small to adequately conserve a viable subpopulation. Essentially, this means the conservation of the species relies on the cooperation of private landowners and managers, particularly in large conservancy areas. However, whilst the geographical distribution of the species may be greater than previously documented, the actual occurrence of the species is highly fragmented and patchy within this area (Wilson 2016), which may have resulted in the creation of island subpopulations resulting in limited dispersal opportunities and restricting genetic exchange between subpopulations. Habitat loss or changes have previously been considered the most severe threat to the species. Habitat degradation that results in the loss of prey base is a serious threat, but changing agricultural practices may, in some instances, actually benefit the species by providing artificially high rodent populations for prey and fewer apex carnivores to compete with.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most serious long-term threat for Black-footed Cats is the loss of key resources, such as den sites and prey, from anthropogenic disturbance or habitat degradation (for example from overgrazing). They are unable to create or maintain their own dens or burrows and rely on those made by other species. Thus, the localised removal of a sympatric species, Springhare or Ground Squirrels with whom they have a commensal (inquilistic) relationship, may be detrimental to their continued existence in a region (B. Wilson unpubl data., Olbricht and Sliwa 1987, Sliwa 2013). Springhares are often considered as a problem or damage-causing species requiring some control measures by farmers. Although a rodent, Springhares are long-lived with a slow reproductive rate and they do not recover easily from a severe reduction in numbers. In Botswana, the unregulated subsistence hunting of the Springhares for bushmeat has resulted in the eradication of the species in some regions (Butynski 1973, 2013), and with them in all likelihood the Black-footed Cats (Wilson 2016). Bushmeat hunting may be increasing in both scope and scale within southern African savannas (Lindsey et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/><br/>The impact of mesopredators may be increasing across South African rangelands (Avenant and du Plessis 2008). In general, numbers of Black-footed Cats and other larger carnivores are negatively related due to intraguild predation. Annually, the BFCWG loses about 50% of all radio-collared cats to larger predators (BFCWG unpubl. data). The BFCWG believes that the most vulnerable individuals (kittens and subadults – below 1 kg) are the more likely victims of predation but since these individuals are difficult to monitor (too small to fit a radio collar) the actual rate of loss is unknown. Similarly, during a study over 2006–2008 on Benfontein Farm, Northern Cape Province, two Black-footed Cats were killed by predation, at least one was from Black-backed Jackals (Kamler et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Wilson 2016) and another by a Caracal (Wilson 2016). Thus, although Black-footed Cats can co-exist with Black-backed Jackals by using burrows during the day (see above for synergistic interaction) and also taking refuge in them at night during danger (A. Sliwa pers. obs.), and by partitioning activity and diets (Kamler et al.</em></em></em> 2015), increasing Black-backed Jackal abundance caused by anthropogenic disturbance and loss of apex predators is likely to increase Black-footed Cat mortality. The BFCWG also has evidence of cats killed by traditional herding dogs and the popularity of Anatolian shepherd dogs with sheep farmers is potentially a new emerging threat (Sliwa et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Wilson 2016).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats are also lost through indirect persecution, such as accidental poisonings (for example locust spraying, predator control lures/baits) and general predator persecution throughout most of their range in South Africa (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sliwa 2013). Recently, there has been an increased interest for this species in the trophy industry as witnessed by permit applications and requests made to taxidermists (Wilson 2016).<br/><br/>The extent of road mortality on cat subpopulations is not known. The incident rate recorded in the Endangered Wildlife Trust road collision database is limited to a few records (W. Collinson unpubl. data). However, only 3% out of 790 locality records were road collision casualties (Wilson 2016).<br/><br/>Although an inherited trait, and previously thought to be limited only to inbred captive populations, Black-footed Cats show a high prevalence for AA-amyloidosis. (Olbricht and Sliwa 1987, Terio et al.</em> 2008). This is a disease characterised by fibrillar protein depositions in many organs as a result of chronic inflammatory processes usually culminating in renal failure. About 70% of the documented deaths of captive cats internationally are as a result of this disease. However, the presence of amyloid in free-ranging subpopulations was detected by Terio et al.</em></em></em> (2008) from samples provided by the BFCWG. This provides additional evidence for a species predilection and supports the existence of a possible familial type of amyloidosis in the species. Habitat fragmentation and subpopulation isolation can only exacerbate this disease at subpopulation levels, whilst at the same time, the disease is a major reason why currently global captive breeding programmes are not self-sustainable (A.Sliwa pers. comm.). As wild subpopulations become genetically isolated, reduced genetic variability threatens population viability by increasing susceptibility to disease and reducing reproductive fitness. An additional consequence of habitat fragmentation and population isolation is increased contact with other carnivores and the pathogens they carry. Because Black-footed Cats share their territory, prey base, and infectious disease susceptibility with many small carnivores, and even domestic dogs and cats, this provides numerous opportunities for disease transmission (Lamberski et al.</em></em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Black-footed Cats are also vulnerable to natural disasters such as flooding of dens and den collapses (Sliwa et al.</em></em></em> 2009). The long-term effects of climate change cannot be overlooked and may lead to changes in range, changes in timing of breeding events, increases in severe weather such as flooding and droughts, as well as increased disease patterns or risks of the spread of pathogens from parasites.<br/><br/>Fortunately, unlike the African Wildcat, this species does not hybridize easily with other cat species. The only confirmed hybrid cases (Black-footed Cats and domestic cats) were under captive conditions (Leyhausen 1979). None have been recorded from the wild (A. Sliwa and B. Wilson pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Current habitat trend: Previously believed to be restricted mostly to panveld and short grass areas, Black-footed Cats occupy a wide range of open arid and semi-arid habitats where they favour any vegetation cover that is low and not too dense, where they have even been sporadically recorded on fallow agricultural fields and in extremely overgrazed areas (Wilson 2016). They are therefore not restricted by habitat throughout most of their distribution in southern Africa. However, overgrazing from livestock farms leads to bush encroachment which reduces the habitat suitability for their normal prey items. The species is highly adaptable and reports of individuals utilising open agricultural areas suggests that the cats may respond to seasonal fluctuations of rodent populations associated with sowing and harvesting activities. However, given the unpredictable nature of these events, and associated risks due to the proximity to humans and their domestic carnivores, the benefit to resident cats is uncertain. Also there is no research as to how these human-dominated landscapes are used by Black-footed Cats and whether these specific records are due to the fact that they are exposed and highly frequented by human observers (A. Sliwa pers. obs.).","The Black-footed Cat is naturally rare compared to the other small cats of southern Africa (Sliwa 2013). Camera trapping for this species is particularly difficult due to secretive behaviour and small size. For example, in over 790 records, only one was from a camera trap (B. Wilson unpubl. data). Black-footed Cats move quickly and do not habitually use game tracks or roads like other animals. Since 2006, there has been extensive effort to establish the historical and current distribution of the species (Wilson 2016). Prior to 2000, there were only 251 specimen records including fossil specimens available for the species. Since then, more than 545 records have been collected with an emphasis on locality data. It is now clear that the species has been previously under-sampled. Throughout its entire range there are only c.</em></em></em></em></em> 692 verifiable locality records which can be reliably mapped (Wilson 2016). As such, it is difficult to determine density, and thus a population estimate, for this species. High-density estimates come from two study sites at Benfontein and Nuwejaarsfontein in the Northern Cape province of South Africa with over 17,000 fixes and 1,600 hours of observation of radio-collared individuals (Sliwa 2004, Sliwa et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010): For Benfontein, between 1998 and 1999, density (based on radio-collared individuals) was estimated at 0.17 cats / km² but only 0.08 km² between 2005 and 2014. For Nuwejaarsfontein, density was estimated at 0.06 cats / km² from 2009–2014 (Sliwa 2004, Sliwa et al.</em></em></em></em></em>, 2014). However, these two sites may represent exceptionally high densities due to favourable climate and human management, and low-quality habitat densities are probably much lower (Sliwa 2013). Thus, we suspect that densities of 0.03 / km² represent more realistic higher densities across larger scales and represent viable subpopulations in the long-term (B. Wilson and A. Sliwa unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Using these density estimates, population size was calculated by converting kernel densities based on verified records (both historical and recent) to high (0.03 cats / km²), medium (0.02 cats / km²) and low density (0.01 cats / km²) isopleths in ArcGIS across the entire range of the species in the assessment region. The population sizes from the density bands were then summed to produce an overall population estimate. The best estimate yielded an estimated 13,867 individuals within the assessment region, of which 9,707 are mature (assuming a 70% mature population structure, Table 1). These estimates were calculated from the range-wide heat map (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). See the attached Supplementary Information for more details on methodology.<br/><br/>Additionally, no subpopulation is suspected to have more than 1,000 mature individuals. However, the definition of a subpopulation for this species needs further work depending on dispersal rates and distances, connectivity and genetic subpopulation structure, although small home range sizes of the species—minimum estimate for females is 7.1–8.6 km² (Sliwa 2004, Kamler et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015)—may suggest small subpopulation sizes. Unpublished data suggest dispersal distance of 20 km (A. Sliwa unpubl. data), and we suspect that clusters within 50 km of each other and distances of 100 km apart would separate subpopulations. This would mean a cluster within an area of 1,963 km² or 2,500 km² would yield subpopulation sizes of 334 and 425 individuals (using 0.17 cats / km²) respectively.<br/><br/>These estimates of course suffer from lack of consistent search effort and thus density zones may be confounded by field surveys that differ in methodology and single records may represent substantially higher density areas, reflecting the lack of field surveys conducted in the region. As such, population estimates are likely to be underestimates. This may especially be the case for the global estimate, as areas outside South Africa may be significantly under-sampled, although it is likely that these areas exhibit lower densities anyway (M. Küsters, pers. comm. for Namibia). Given that the South African core of the range is fairly well-sampled, the population estimate is likely to be more robust and the analysis represents a replicable first-step methodology that can be improved with further field surveys and ecological studies. It should also be noted that estimates of population sizes are sensitive to the relative size of the high-density clusters, thus a more conservative estimate would yield a lower population size, while a less conservative estimate would yield a larger population size. For example increasing the high-density isopleth to cover 70% of the records (up from 50%), yields a global population estimate of 16,853 individuals (11,797 mature). We also note that the density estimates used for the isopleths are precautionary and replicated studies in different regions should be conducted to properly calibrate the density bands.<br/><br/>There is a higher density in the central part of South Africa, along a North-South axis with decreasing frequency of records either West or East of this region and northwards in the range (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>A decline is suspected over the general range, with only some central areas indicating stable subpopulations. However, it is difficult to demonstrate decline in a species that is so hard to census. Preliminary evidence for inferring a continuing decline comes from the long-term study area Benfontein in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, where the density in years 1998–1999 was 0.17 cats / km² (Sliwa 2004), and over the past 10 years (2005–2015) was only 0.08 cats / km², which is documented in field reports (for example, Sliwa et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Local subpopulations may also be low or even absent in areas where Black-backed Jackals and Caracal are abundant due to interspecific competition, including intraguild predation (but see Kamler et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015), which may be especially true of juveniles. About 50% of all radio collared cats are lost to larger predators (Black-footed Cat Working Group unpubl. data).",,Decreasing,"Black-footed Cats have the most restricted distribution of any of the African felid species (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species is endemic to the arid grasslands, dwarf shrub, and savannah of the Karoo and Kalahari in southern Africa. The majority of the range occurs within the boundaries of South Africa, thinning out northwards into Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe (Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). The species is found primarily in Namibia and South Africa, but also Botswana (where there are historical records but only limited recent ones), marginally in Zimbabwe and likely marginally in extreme southern Angola (Sliwa 2013).<br/><br/>In South Africa, where the majority of research effort has taken place, recent records suggest range expansions in virtually all directions from previous literature (Wilson et al.</em> 2016.). It is unlikely that true range extensions have occurred but is rather an artefact of reporting bias as a result of recently increased citizen scientist reports combined with increased research effort (Wilson 2016). On the eastern side of its range, occurrence records are confirmed to just west of the Kruger National Park, into north-western KwaZulu-Natal, and new data suggest that the species occurs further south and south-westwards in the Southern Cape and more westwards in the Northern Cape than previously realised (Wilson 2016). The occurrence of the species in Swaziland (M. Reilly and A. Monadjem pers. comm. 2014) and Lesotho (N. Avenant pers. comm. 2014) is considered highly unlikely and certainly no records exist to date.<br/><br/>Apart from Addo Elephant National Park and Mountain Zebra National Park in the Eastern Cape Province, and SA Lombard Nature Reserve in North West Province, there appears to be no consistent sightings of Black-footed Cats in formally protected areas, despite considerable research effort and game drive reporting (Wilson 2016). This is likely due to unsuitable habitat or the presence of a higher density of mesopredators which increases competition and incidences of intraguild predation. They probably occur in Karoo National Park. However, further field surveys are needed to determine in which protected areas subpopulations of the species are resident.<br/><br/>The current extent of occurrence in South Africa is roughly about 930,000 km² (Wilson 2016). However, we suspect that area of occupancy is considerably lower, due to sensitivity to environmental disturbances and threats (Sliwa 2013).","The Black-footed Cat is accidentally killed in indiscriminate trapping, hunting (rifle and dogs) and poisoning events aimed at other damage-causing carnivores. However, as a protected species these incidents are never reported for fear of persecution (Wilson 2016). At least one specimen record reported to B. Wilson was of a Khoisan man in the Kalahari wearing a skin as part of a loincloth. He indicated that he obtained the skin from a roadkill from the neighbouring Botswana area. Similarly, there are anecdotal reports of skins in households in the central Karoo (M. Drouilly pers. obs. 2014), Also, one flat skin was obtained from a sheep guard close to Biesjiesfontein in the Victoria West area in 2012, likely killed by his hunting dogs (A. Sliwa pers. obs. 2012).<br/><br/>Applications have been made for legal hunting permits in the Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, but have never been granted. However, several South Africa taxidermists have acknowledged having mounted hunted animals (Wilson 2016), indicating that there is some interest in the hunting industry for the species.<br/><br/>In the 1970s, there was a demand for the species by overseas zoos and export permits were granted for cats to be caught and exported from the Eastern Cape Province. During further investigations, it was revealed that many of these cats actually came from the then-Cape Province (now part of the Northern Cape Province) (Olbricht and Sliwa 1997). More recently, it has become an acknowledged fact that this species does not thrive in captivity and the demand for wild-caught individuals has diminished considerably (Sliwa and Schürer 2006). Zoos now maintain and exchange animals between institutions. To increase genetic diversity in these captive populations, in vitro fertilisation attempts have been made using oocytes of a captive females and semen collected from a wild-caught male during annual field research trips conducted by the Black-footed Cat Working Group (BFCWG, Herrick et al.</em></em> 2010), but without generating a viable embryo. <br/><br/>Whilst even predator-proof fencing is not an effective barrier for Black-footed Cats, the effects of wildlife ranching are currently unknown and further research is required to conclusively determine if this land-use practice differs from other farming practices. Since larger carnivores are often introduced and managed, the presence of these is likely to have a negative effect on Black-footed Cats due to intraguild predation. This is perhaps the reason why this species does not occur in formally protected wildlife areas like South Africa’s Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park and Kruger National Park but may be reported in peripheral areas. Effectively, large areas of intensive wildlife ranching could amplify the island habitat effect that already prevents movements between subpopulations, further threatening the species. This hypothesis should be tested.",Terrestrial,"Black-footed Cat presence in formally protected areas remains low to non-existent, particularly in those large enough to maintain subpopulations, for example, Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. It is unclear in how many protected areas they occur. However, the major Karoo protected areas – Karoo, Mountain Zebra and Addo Elephant National Parks – may each protect a small but not self-sustaining population. Hunting of this species is banned in South Africa and Botswana and it is protected across most of its range excluding Namibia and Zimbabwe (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Although the Black-footed Cat has been recorded at least marginally in all of the South African provinces, the effectiveness of local protection measures remains in question.<br/><br/>Key interventions for the species include:<br/><ol><li>Judicious management of larger predators and mesopredators: this is a holistic approach that includes only controlling true problem animals, ensuring that fields are not overgrazed or overstocked so as to sustain natural small mammal prey, and reintroducing or tolerating apex predators to roam and exert top down influences on mesopredators. The effect should be to reduce unnaturally high mesopredator density. Improved sheep-farming practices (for example, synchronised breeding events, kraaling at night, and shepherd systems, lethal control of only proven problem mesopredators) should also be trialled.</li><li>The establishment of large conservancy areas to create viable Black-footed Cat subpopulations and facilitate ecological separation between Black-footed Cats and larger carnivores (Kamler et al.</em> 2015). The fragmentation of suitable habitats and potential isolation of subpopulations makes the formation or maintenance of dispersal corridors important in the prevention of inbreeding and prevalence of inherited diseases such as AA-amyloidosis. Despite its small size, individuals have very large home ranges, and to conserve subpopulations and create corridors, the emphasis should be on the establishment of large conservancy areas with suitable conditions for the species. This is particularly important in areas where the prospects of a formally protected area are unlikely.</li><li>Similarly, conservancies and private lands with low apex predator density can be targeted as possible sites for Black-footed Cat stewardship.</li><li>Human activities that lead to habitat degradation and the loss of prey species need to be addressed, particularly in the Karoo region which is likely to be the remaining stronghold region for the species. This should also be achieved by creating awareness to the presence and needs of the species among landowners to reduce accidental persecution, whilst providing information about the special needs of Black-footed Cats that would enable them to be actively involved in the protection of the species.</li><li>This may also include generally raising public awareness of the cryptic species and encouraging citizen scientists to submit distribution records through the promotion of citizen science platforms. This has been done previously with the use of posters created by the BFCWG requesting the public to report sightings of the species, the bulk of the data having been used to establish a more accurate geographical distribution of the species (Wilson 2016).</li><li>Other interventions can involve applying stiffer legal penalties to people involved in deliberate persecution of the species or illegally keeping or trading with the species. </li></ol>In the long-term, the creation of a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species as an interim or pre-emptive conservation measure should be investigated which could be linked to the already existing international and national ex situ</em> management plans. Currently there is no consistent and self-sustaining breeding and survival of cats in South African facilities and some only maintain their stocks by receiving rescued/confiscated individuals from the wild. We suggested the establishment of a national breeding studbook for Black-footed Cats, which would then allow a better overview on the stocks, which could then also feed to the international studbook, maintained by Wuppertal Zoo in Germany since 1991.<br/><br/><strong>Recommendations for land managers and practitioners:</strong><br/><br/>Currently, there are no conservation plans for Black-footed Cats and the urgency to create such plans is undermined by the paucity of data at a national level. It is anticipated the numbers will decrease over the next 20-year period, but during this period, available data should give a clear picture as to the areas of range that are most affected, and the best possible interventions needed.<br/><ul><li>Currently, at an international level, due to its already low numbers, it is one of the species listed in the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Plan program developed in 1981. However, the as-yet undetermined subspecies status (Felis n. nigripes</em> and F. n. thomasi</em>) may undermine and place in jeopardy the international holdings and ex situ</em> management strategies for the species as a whole. A number of zoos have captive individuals and an international stud book is maintained for the species. Success in captive conditions is fraught by failure of individuals to thrive due to their highly specialised needs and the effects of inbreeding and/or AA-amyloidosis. Thus, ex situ</em> conservation efforts are not recommended.</li><li>Translocation of individuals without the monitoring of the released cats to determine survival rates is not advocated or advised as displaced individuals may suffer a high mortality rate. Systematic monitoring in areas identified as under-sampled should be established to improve population estimates and scan for stewardship sites.</li><li>The presence/absence of the species in formally protected areas must be ascertained.<br/></li></ul><strong>Research priorities:<br/></strong><br/>The Black-footed Cat has been extensively studied for more than 20 years near the Kimberley area, along the Free State-Northern Cape border. The Black-footed Cat Working Group focuses on the ecology, reproductive biology, geographical range, habitat preferences, health and conservation of the species. This provided information about the diet (Sliwa 2006, Sliwa et al.</em> 2010), home range size and social organization (Sliwa 2004), ecological relationships between the species and other sympatric carnivores (Kamler et al.</em> 2015).&#160; More recently, the BFCWG extended this study to include farms south of De Aar, Northern Cape Province in a different habitat type with different farming practices in place. However, there is little information for elsewhere within its range and the following are considered research priorities:<br/><br/>Fine-scale distributional studies across the distributional range. This will hopefully lead to more accurate subpopulation estimates. Long-term monitoring of subpopulation trends are also needed throughout the species’ geographic range, particularly in ecologically distinct areas and under varying farming practices. Kitten mortality and survival rates also need to be quantified.<br/><br/><ul><li>Similarly, studies on changes in density across a spectrum of habitat quality are needed to refine conservation plans and subpopulation estimates. Fine-scale determination on what habitat characteristics and prey populations are required for female Black-footed Cats to successfully raise their kittens is also needed. </li></ul>The impacts and extent of persecution (both direct and indirect) and the efficacy of education and awareness programmes targeted at landowners.<br/><br/>Genetic investigation into the subspecies status is needed as the results may have conservation implications.<br/><ul><li>Investigation into causes and extent of AA-amyloidosis in wild populations.</li><li>The effects of Black-backed Jackals and Caracals, and possibly other apex carnivores, need to be quantified.</li><li>The degree of inquilism and dependence on Springhares burrow systems for refuge, and thus long-term survival of cats following of the removal of Springhare subpopulations, needs to be determined.</li><li>Studies into the dispersal abilities and survival of subadult Black-footed Cats in different habitats. Effects of electric fences on local movements and dispersal patterns must be understood to assess the effects of long-term geographical isolation on subpopulation structure.

50652361,60354712,Felis silvestris,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>               The Wild Cat is the most common and widely distributed wild felid, and thus listed as Least Concern. However, introgressive hybridization with domestic cats is considered extensive, and taking place across almost the entire range, potentially resulting in cryptic extirpations of some populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996; Macdonald et al</em>. 2004, 2010; Driscoll et al</em>. 2007, 2011). Although detailed information concerning introgression is not available for most parts of its distribution, based on less biased samplings, local introgression rate is estimated &#160;20% in Swiss Jura (Nussberger et al.</em> 2014), 36% in France (Say et al.</em> 2012), and 43% in west Germany (Hertwig et al.</em> 2009), and 46% of wild-living cats in France may belong to a non-Wild Cat group (Say et al.</em> 2012), whilst the figure may be as high as 88% in Scotland (Kitchener et al.</em> 2005). However, introgression may be evaluated differently in each of these studies, making comparisons problematic. Even less information is available to assess temporal changes in introgression rates. Future research on hybridization levels and fitness consequences of introgression may warrant a reassessment of the Wild Cat as a threatened species, owing to population declines of the Wild Cat.</p>","Wildcats are found in a wide variety of habitats, from deserts and scrub grassland to dry and mixed forest; absent only from rainforest and coniferous forest. European wildcats are primarily associated with forest and are found in highest numbers in broad-leaved or mixed forests with low population densities of humans. They are also found in Mediterranean maquis scrubland, riparian forest, marsh boundaries and along sea coasts. Areas of intensive cultivation and urbanisation are avoided. Wildcats in Africa are found everywhere outside tropical rainforest, although thinly distributed in true desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Asian Wildcats range up to 2,000 - 3,000 m in mountainous areas with sufficient vegetation, but are most typically associated with scrub desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/> <br/> Rodents and lagomorphs are the staple of the Wildcat's diet across its range, with birds of secondary importance, although a variety of small prey is taken, and wildcats also scavenge (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/> <br/> Phelan and Sliwa (2006) found large home ranges (52.7 km² for a radio-collared female) in desert in the United Arab Emirates, larger than home ranges reported elsewhere in more optimal haibtat – 6 - 10 km² for females in South Africa's Kalahari Gemsbok National Park (Herbst and Mills 2005 in Stuart et al.</em> 2013) and 1 - 2 km² for females in Scotland and France (Stahl et al.</em> 1988, Macdonald et al.</em> 2004).","Wild Cats are most threatened by domestic cats. Although the lack of information, especially outside Europe, prevents us from drawing a general conclusion, hybridization is considered widespread; there may be very few Wild Cat populations remaining where there is little history of hybridization with the domestic cat (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Macdonald et al.</em> 2004, Phelan and Sliwa 2006, Driscoll et al.</em> 2007). Feral domestic cats also compete with Wild Cats for prey and space, and there is a high potential for disease transmission between domestic cats and Wild Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yamaguchi et al.</em> 1996, Daniels et al.</em> 1999, Macdonald et al.</em> 2004). <br/> <br/> Other threats include significant human-caused mortality, in Europe, especially road kills (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Lüps et al.</em> 2002, Schulenberg 2005). The species is still considered a pest in Scotland and is illegally persecuted (Macdonald et al.</em> 2004). Predator control measures in a number of European countries may result in this species being killed as bycatch, e.g. snaring and lamping in Scotland. Wild Cats are also killed as pests in southern Africa, although this does not seem to have resulted in population declines (Stuart et al.</em> 2013). In the past Asian Wild Cats were trapped in large numbers for their fur, although at present there is little international trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). <br/> <br/> Historically, habitat loss led to dramatic declines in Europe and Russia in the 18<sup>th</sup> to mid-20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Macdonald et al.</em> 2004). However, Wild Cats can do well in cultivated landscapes, which increase rodent population densities (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although these are the areas where hybridization with domestic cats occurs and spreads.","<p>The world's population of domestic cats, Felis catus</em>, was estimated as c. 600 million (Baker et al</em>. 2010), making the domesticated descendant of Felis silvestris</em> one of the world's most numerous animals. However, domestic cats hybridise readily with Wildcats, and genetic analysis of “wildcat” samples found that most populations showed evidence of hybridisation (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Driscoll et al.</em> 2007). There are probably very few, if any, “wildcat” populations which have little history of hybridisation with domestic cats. This introgression with domestic cats makes an estimation of Wildcat population size very difficult even in comparison to other similarly elusive wild felids. Morphological criteria and genetic markers have been developed that should help to resolve these problems (Schauenberg 1969, 1977, Randi and Ragni 1986, 1991, French et al.</em> 1988, Beaumont et al.</em> 2001, Reig et al. </em>2001, <span lang=""EN-US"">Pierpaoli&#160; et al. </em>2003, </em>Yamaguchi et al</em>. 2004a,b, Kitchener et al.</em> 2005, Driscoll et al.</em> 2007, 2011, Platz et al.</em> 2011, Nussberger et al</em>. 2013, 2014, Devillard et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> In the Near East region, Wildcats occur at low population densities, and are threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation as well as hybridisation with domestic cats (Phelan and Sliwa 2006).<br/> <br/> Most detailed population information is available about the European subspecies, F.s. silvestris</em>, although there is still a lack of information regarding its current status and population trends. There have been no recent large-scale surveys or European regional reviews of the status of the species (Macdonald et al. </em>2004). During the European Mammal Assessment process (IUCN 2007), information (ranging from detailed national surveys to expert opinion) was collated for a number of European range states and is presented below, but this is by no means a comprehensive review. A review of the status of the Wildcat in Europe in the 1980s and early-mid 1990s can be found in Stahl and Artois (1991) and Nowell and Jackson (1996).<br/> <br/> <strong>Scotland (UK)</strong>: Recent estimates have varied between 1,000 and 4,000 (compared to 1.2 million feral cats in Britain), but as few as 400 cats which meet morphological and genetic criteria for being the furthest from the domestic group may survive (Macdonald et al.</em> 2004, Battersby 2005, Kitchener et al.</em> 2005, Macdonald et al</em>. 2010). If so, this population would be Critically Endangered (Kitchener et al.</em> 2005). A survey of mostly sightings from 2006-2008 confirmed that the overall distribution had changed little from the late 1980s, with most frequent sightings in eastern and central Scotland and a small area of the West (Davis and Gray, 2010).</p>  <p><strong>Portugal</strong>: The population is suspected to be decreasing (M. Fernandes pers. comm. 2006). Considered Vulnerable at the national level, on the basis of suspected declines reaching 30% over three generations in the past or future (Cabral et al.</em> 2005).<br/> <strong>Spain</strong>: In some places it is increasing and others decreasing (J. Herrero pers. comm. 2006). Considered Vulnerable at the national level, on the basis of suspected declines of over 30% over the last three generations (Palomo and Gisbert 2002).<br/> <strong>Belgium</strong>: Evidence from Wildcats found dead on roads indicated that the species is gradually expanding its range to the north and west. There are no data on population size (Libois 2006).<br/> <strong>Germany</strong>: The population was recently estimated at 1,700-5,000 individuals (Knapp et al.</em> 2000). The population may be increasing and occupying new areas (M. Stubbe pers. comm. 2006, Hartmann et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p><strong>France</strong>: The presence of Wildcats was confirmed in an area of c. 155,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the north-eastern quarter of France and around the Pyrenees, but these two areas are separated by a wide zone with no wildcats (Say et al.</em> 2012). Wildcats may have extended their range in France by c. 30% in the last 30 years, although a cautious interpretation is necessary (Say et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p><strong>Switzerland</strong>: Based on a systematic survey, about 220-1300 km<sup>2</sup> of the Swiss Jura region are occupied by about 160-930 wildcats (95% CI, Swiss Wildcat Monitoring 2008-10, Federal Office of Environment). Since 1970, wildcats have extended their range to the South-West and East of the Jura (ref. within Nussberger et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p><strong>Italy</strong>: The population densities on Sicily based on camera trapping are 0.28 – 0.93 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>, whilst an estimate based on individual identification using DNA extracted from scats estimated 1.36 individuals per km<sup>2</sup> (Anile et al.</em> 2010, 2012, 2014).&#160;&#160; &#160;<br/> <strong>Slovenia</strong>: The population is estimated (on the basis of population density and habitat suitability) at no more than 2,000; it is stable. Recently expanded highways possibly pose some threat in the South-East part of its high population density range. (B. Krytufek pers. comm. 2006)<br/> <strong>Poland</strong>: Estimated number of wildcats in Poland is between 100 and 150 individuals and estimated population density is 1-1.3 per 1000 ha (Okarma et al.</em> 2002). The current distribution of wildcat in the Polish Carpathians, mainly along the borders with Slovakia and Ukraine, shows that the Polish population forms a continuum with Slovakian and Ukrainian populations. Together they constitute the northernmost part of the larger Carpathian population of this species. The species is decreasing and is considered endangered (EN) in the Red Data Book of Poland (Wolsan and Okarma</em> 2001).<br/> <strong>Slovakia</strong>: The estimate of the Slovakian population in 2000 was about 1,500 individuals (unpublished data of the Slovak Environmental Agency: A. Olszanska pers. comm. 2006). <br/> <strong>Serbia</strong>: There are large populations along the southern Danube (IUCN 2007).<br/> <strong>Macedonia</strong>: The species is widespread (IUCN 2007).<br/> <strong>Greece</strong>: The Wildcat is widespread in continental Greece with sightings in all forested areas and many wetlands. There are apparently more sightings in North and North-East Greece, where the population density seems to be higher. The population trend has not been quantified, but is believed to be stable. </p>  <p><strong>Romania</strong>: The population is estimated to number c.10,000 individuals, but this is not based on quantitative data (Red Data Book of Romania). <br/> <strong>Bulgaria</strong>: There are no quantitative data, but the species is considered relatively abundant (Spassov et al.</em> 1997).<br/> <strong>European Russia</strong>: the population size and trend have not been quantified, but there are thought to be large, relatively stable populations (IUCN 2007).<br/> <br/> In Scotland, 88% of wild-living cats may be hybrids or feral domestic cats (Kitchener et al.</em> 2005), and in Italy and Hungary the proportion of hybrids is estimated at 8% and 25-31% respectively (Pierpaoli et al.</em> 2003, Lecis et al.</em> 2006). On the basis of museum specimens, the proportion of hybrids in Bulgaria was estimated at 8-10% (Spassov et al.</em> 1997), but the extent of hybridisation may have increased since this study. The hybridisation rate was observed to be 14 % in Portugal (Oliveira et al.</em> 2008), 4 % in eastern and 43 % in western Germany (Hertwig et al. </em>2009) and 36 % in France where 46% of wild-living cats may belong to a non-wildcat group (Say et al. </em>2012). In Switzerland, the introgression rate was estimated to be 20%, with a migration rate of 0-0.043 domestic migrants into the wildcat population per generation and 0-0.017 from wildcats into domestic cats (95% CI, Nussberger et al.</em> 2014). Wildcats of mixed origin have also been found in Belgium (Pierpaoli et al.</em> 2003). In general the genetic distance to the domestic cat is larger in the north of the range than in the south (Pierpaoli et al.</em> 2003) and introgression between Wildcat and domestic cat is less in Eastern European populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Outside Europe detailed studies on the extent of hybridisation are rare. Evidence of hybridisation has been found in southern Africa (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yamaguchi et al.</em> 2004b, Stuart et al.</em> 2013) and North Africa (Stuart et al.</em> 2013) although introgressive hybridisation between Wildcats and domestic cats may not be widespread in South Africa (Le Roux et al.</em> 2014).&#160;</p>",,Decreasing,"The Wild Cat has a very broad distribution, found throughout most of Africa, Europe, and southwest and central Asia into India, China, and Mongolia. Four major intraspecific phylogenetic groups, or subspecies (following Driscoll et al</em>. 2007, Macdonald et al</em>. 2010) are distributed as follows:<br/><br/>Steppe Wild Cat Lineage<br/>The African Wild Cat F. s. lybica</em> occurs across northern Africa and extends around the periphery of the Arabian Peninsula to the Caspian Sea (Driscoll et al</em>. 2007), where it meets, and/or hybridizes with, the Asian Wild Cat (Harrison and Bates 1991, Heptner and Sludskii 1992). This extremely wide distributional range is accompanied by a very broad habitat tolerance, being apparently only absent from closed tropical forest. Although thinly distributed in true deserts, such as the Sahara, it occurs especially in association with hill and mountain country, such as the Hoggar. In North Africa it occurs discontinuously from Morocco through Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and into Egypt. It has an extensive distribution across the savannas of West Africa from Mauritania on the Atlantic seaboard, eastwards to the Horn of Africa, Sudan and Ethiopia; southwards it is present in all East and southern African countries (Stuart et al</em>. 2013), where it is replaced by the Southern African Wild Cat F.s. cafra</em> (Driscoll et al</em>. 2007). At present the boundary between the two cannot be determined by available genetic samples, but morphological and biogeographical evidence suggests the break to occur in the southeast, in the area of Tanzania and Mozambique (Kitchener and Rees 2009). The Asian Wild Cat F. s. ornata</em> occurs from the eastern Caspian into western India, and north to Kazakhstan, and into western China and southern Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Driscoll et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Forest Wild Cat Lineage<br/>The European Wild Cat F. s. silvestris</em> was formerly very widely distributed in Europe and is absent only from Fennoscandia. Severe declines and local extirpations occurred in Europe between the late 1700s and mid-1900s, resulting in a fragmented relict distribution (Stahl and Artois 1991, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Piechocki 2001). It became extinct in the Netherlands, but may be recently expanding its range from neighbouring countries to recolonize the country (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Canters et al.</em> 2005). It was considered regionally extinct in Austria (Spitzenberger 2005), but vagrants still occur and the Italian population is spreading northwards into Austria (Lapini and Molinari 2006). It is possibly extinct in the Czech Republic (IUCN 2007). It occurs from sea level to 2,250 m in the Pyrenees (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). In some parts of the Wild Cat's distribution (e.g. Scotland, Stromberg in Germany) it is possible that, as a result of hybridization with the domestic cat, very few Wild Cats remain (Macdonald et al. 2004, Battersby 2005, Herrmann and Vogel 2005). Sicily&#160; is the only Mediterranean island populated by European Wild Cats; populations on other islands (including Sardinia and Corsica) are probably feral domestics stemming from Neolithic times (Gippoliti and Amori 2006, Macdonald et al</em>. 2010, T. Viago in litt. 2009, Mattucci et al</em>. 2013).","In the past Asian Wild Cats were trapped in large numbers for their fur, although at present there is little international trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996).",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II (<a href=""http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php"">http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php</a>). The Wild Cat is fully protected across most of its range in Europe and Asia, but only some of its African range (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although effective implementation of protection on the ground may be a different issue. The European Wild Cat is listed on the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex IV) as a “European protected species of animal”. It is also listed in Appendix II of the Bern Convention. It is classed as threatened at the national level in many European range states (IUCN 2007).&#160; The Asian Wild Cat is legally protected in Afghanistan, having been placed on the country’s first Protected Species List in 2009, which bans all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan. With so little information or data known on this species in Afghanistan, it is also proposed as a priority species for future study. <br/> <br/> The main conservation need includes 1) identifying “wildcat” populations where there is little history of introgressive hybridization with domestic cat, 2) investigating the effects of hybridisation on the fitness of hybrid individuals, and 3) preventing hybridization by neutering and removing feral domestic cats if necessary. Such efforts have been complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing Wild Cats from domestic cats, especially when introgressive hybridization with domestic cats is extensive (Macdonald et al.</em> 2004). However, morphological and genetic methods have been developed, tested, and improved to resolve these problems (Schauenberg 1969, 1977, Randi and Ragni 1986, 1991, French et al.</em> 1988, Beaumont et al.</em> 2001, Reig et al. </em>2001, Pierpaoli&#160; et al. </em>2003, </em>Yamaguchi et al</em>. 2004a,b, Kitchener et al.</em> 2005, Driscoll et al.</em> 2007, 2011, Platz et al.</em> 2011, Nussberger et al</em>. 2013, 2014, Devillard et al.</em> 2014), and to save the Wild Cat from cryptic extinction before it is too late",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is more commonly associated with open formations like savannas, but could also be found in disturbed formations such as pastures (Caso 2013). However, it usually ranks low within the felid guild – de Oliveira <em style=""font-size: 12pt;"">et al</em>. 2010, de Oliveira 2011), therefore, the rampant habitat conversion to industrial agriculture of the Brazilian savannas of the Cerrado biome should pose a serious threat for the species. With density estimates considerably low, extent of occurrence considerably smaller than its extensive area of occupancy, and the negative impact of Ocelots (Caso 2013, de Oliveira <em style=""font-size: 12pt;"">et al</em>. 2010, de Oliveira 2011) <a>it is likely that no conservation units, with the probable exception of the mega-reserves of the Amazon basin could sustain long-term viable populations of Jaguarundis. &#160;</a>In Brazil, that comprises most of the species geographic range, the Jaguarundi was considered Vulnerable (C1), given its reduced area of occupancy (AOO), expected decline of 10% in the next 15 years due to habitat loss and fragmentation, very low population densities and its estimated effective population size (Almeida et al. </em>2013).&#160;In&#160;Mexico, it seems that most Jaguarundi populations are stable, however, the subspecies&#160;P. y. cacomitli</em>&#160;(Gulf Coast Jaguarundi) of northeast&#160;Mexico&#160;is the most in danger. This species could already be Near Threatened (A3c), however, there is not currently enough information to make this judgement range wide. Therefore, the species is listed as Least Concern but it should be regularly reviewed.","The Jaguarundi occupies a broad range of both open and closed habitats, from Monte desert, semi-arid thorn scrub, restinga, swamp and savanna woodland to primary rainforest (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  However, in open areas it sticks to vegetative cover, including secondary growth habitat, disturbed areas, and human induced grasslands (Mexico), open areas with some protection, provided forest or other dense cover is present (de Oliveira 1994, Caso 2013). This felid is perceived as more tolerant of human disturbance due to its use of open habitats.<br/><br/>This small-sized felid (5 kg) body shape suggests the species to be mostly terrestrial. However, it moves about easily in trees (de Oliveira 1994). Its litter size is 1.9 kittens (1–4). Because it is mostly diurnal, it tends to be the most easily seen Neotropical felid, which lead to the false assumption it was common. Diet includes mostly small mammals, birds and reptiles, with a mean prey mass of 380 g. However, larger sized prey (&gt;1 kg) are not unusual (de Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, de Oliveira et al.</em> 2010). Home range size varies greatly, ranging up to 100 km², larger than for any other Neotropical small cat (Konecny 1989),&#160;but smaller in Mexico (16.2 male; 12.1 female &#160;km²) (Caso 2013).  The species is not the dominant small cat species in most areas, even in most areas of open habitats. Additionally, Jaguarundi is also negatively impacted by Ocelots (the “ocelot effect”) (de Oliveira et al</em>. 2010, Caso 2013).  It has several colour morphs - brownish-black, grey and reddish yellow - which can even be found in the same litter (de Oliveira 1998).","The species is generally not exploited for commercial trade, although Jaguarundis are doubtless caught in traps set for commercially valuable species and may be subject to low intensity hunting pressure around settled areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Its main threats are however, habitat loss and fragmentation, especially for large scale agriculture and pasture. Jaguarundis are commonly killed for killing poultry (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007, Caso 2013).","Contrary to earlier characterizations of this species as relatively common and abundant (Nowell and Jackson 1996), research indicates that the Jaguarundi is an uncommon, low density species.  Densities are very low everywhere it has been sampled, and Jaguarundis are more commonly found at 0.01-0.05/km² or lower (de Oliveira et al.</em> submitted), but reaching up to 0.2/km² in a few and restricted high density areas (Caso 2013).  The Jaguarundi’s density/numbers are negatively impacted by those of the larger sized Ocelot (the “ocelot effect”) (de Oliveira et al.</em> 2010, Caso 2013).  Considered Near Threatened in Argentina (Diaz and Ojeda 2000) and threatened in Mexico (SEMARNAT 2010).",,Decreasing,"The Jaguarundi occurs from the eastern lowlands of Chipinque National Park in Nuevo Leon, Mexico (NE limit) and the western lowlands of Mexico, all the way to southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay (Dotta et al.</em> 2007) and south through central Argentina at ca</em> 39ºS.

Further studies are required on the species ecology, demographics, natural history, and threats.

97204446,15309,Leopardus colocolo,Near Threatened,,2016,2014-04-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Pampas Cat is generally rare or very rare (0.05-0.2 individuals/km²) and localized throughout most of its range, and appears to be declining in several parts of its extent of occurrence because of extensive loss or reduction in quality of its habitat. Predation by dogs, hunting and road kills are additional threats. Population decline caused by loss of habitat is widespread and is a primary concern. Although little data is available on the rate of loss of natural habitats across the Pampas Cat range, we have some information from the Gran Chaco region that covers a large portion of Pampas Cat’s distribution range. The Gran Chaco forest extends over parts of northern Argentina, western Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, and western Brazil and occupies an approximate area of 1,141,000 km². Deforestation started in the 1970s and accelerated in 2002-2006. Following the global increase in commodity prices, it is likely that the rates of deforestation have maintained or increased in the last decade. Based on the data from the dry Chaco region, a portion of the whole Gran Chaco covering 790,000 km²&#160; the yearly rate of transformation of forest into cropland (a habitat type where Pampas Cat do not occur) ranges from 0.63 to 1.75% (Clark et al.</em> 2010). Thus, adopting a generation length of seven years (Pacifici et al.</em> 2013) and assuming that transformed habitat becomes unavailable to the Pampas Cat, populations of this species could be suffering a 36.5% declination rate over three generations.<br/><br/>Another issue is that possibly the Pampas Cat should not be assessed as a single evolutionary unit. The taxonomy of this species is not yet resolved but the available evidence (morphological, genetic and ecological) indicates that there are clear differences among regional subpopulations, which have been proposed to represent distinct subspecies or even species. It is reasonable to consider the conservation status of these regional populations separately, because there may be little (or even no) historical and/or current gene flow among some of them, implying that limited genetic connectivity may further threaten the long term viability of the species as a whole.<br/><br/>Because of all the above and because the reasons for its rarity and population numbers are not known, the limited information available indicates Near Threatened as the most likely category (it almost qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A2c). Nevertheless, it may qualify as Vulnerable in the near future and hence requires monitoring.","The Pampas Cat has a wide distribution outside the moist forests of South America, being associated with more open habitats. It typically inhabits dry scrub and grassland, but can also be found in dry woodland as well as swampy wetland and rocky areas (Silveira 1995, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Pereira et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Tellaeche 2015). Its prey includes small mammals as well as ground-dwelling birds (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Silveira et al.</em></em></em> 2005). In the high Andes the diet is based on mountain viscacha and small rodents (Walker et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Napolitano et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Fajardo et al.</em></em></em> 2014). In Brazil's Emas National Park, Pampas cats are primarily diurnal with some crepuscular and occasionally nocturnal activity. Home ranges (90% MCP) averaged 19.47 +/- 3.64 km² (Silveira et al.</em></em></em> 2005). In the High Andes 71% of camera trap photos were taken at night and more than 20% during the day (Lucherini et al.</em></em></em> 2009) and average home range size (95% Kernel) was 14.9 km² (Tellaeche 2015).","Habitat loss (to agricultural cropland) and degradation (by livestock grazing) is considered the major threat to this species throughout most of its range. Retaliatory killing for poultry depredation is also a threat, as are road kills.<br/><br/>In the High Andes of Bolivia and Peru the Pampas Cat is threatened by decreasing habitat quality caused by increased anthropogenic modification. In these regions, it is also actively persecuted by local people and often killed by dogs.<br/><br/>In Argentina, extensive habitat loss/modification due to the expansion of the agriculture frontier, mining, and oil extraction is the major threat.<br/><br/>The biggest threat to the species in Brazil is habitat loss, especially because of silviculture and agriculture expansion, as well as habitat conversion/degradation, mostly through fire. Given its rarity in Brazil, road kills are also considered a threat for some populations. In the Brazilian Pampas, predation by domestic dogs and hunting due to real or perceived conflicts, a problem that apparently has not been detected in the Cerrado yet (where it would be more incidental than widespread). A zone of hybridization between L. colocolo</em> and L. tigrinus</em> has been demonstrated by genetic analysis in central Brazil (Trigo et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>In Peru, it is actively persecuted as it often kills chickens of local people, and is also impacted by dogs. Forest loss appears to be also an important threat.","The Pampas Cat populations living in the High Andes and Puna eco-regions appear to be able to reach relatively high densities (0.74-0.78 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) in the most productive habitat patches (Gardner et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The population appears to be stable in these regions of Argentina and in slight decline in Bolivia and Peru because of decreasing habitat quality caused by increased anthropogenic modification.<br/><br/>The Pampas Cat is a naturally rare species in most of Patagonia, where records of its presence are scarce in comparison with those of other felids (e.g. Geoffroy´s Cat, Puma).<br/><br/>In the Argentine Mesopotamia (Corrientes province), a couple of records (road-killed animals) were obtained during the last decade, but almost no evidence was recorded through camera trapping for the Iberá wetlands in spite of intensive trapping effort, thus suggesting that the species is rare in this region.<br/><br/>The Pampas Cat appears to be declining in central Argentina (Cordoba, San Luis), mainly due to habitat modification (i.e. soybean crop expansion), and is regionally extinct in the Pampas grasslands, where it only occurs in the southern and dry portion (Pereira et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002 and recent unpublished surveys). In the Argentine Espinal, population numbers are low (0.11-0.17 individuals/ km<sup>2</sup>, lower than for the Geoffroy’s Cat, Caruso et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and distribution is largely limited to grassland habitats that are threatened by human activities. Pampas cat are similarly rare in the adjacent southern part of the Monte eco-region (Pereira et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Pampas Cat records are very scarce in the Yungas eco-region of NW Argentina, where it is limited to the high-altitude grasslands (Di Bitetti et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>A survey on small cats has found no records of Pampas Cats in the Bolivian Chaco dry forest (Cuellar et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In Brazil, the Pampas Cat inhabits open areas, such as the grasslands of the Pampas, the marshy Pantanal, and particularly the savannas of the Cerrado (Araujo Bagno 2004). The species is considered typically rare and with low population densities, typically of 0.01–0.05 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (or lower), throughout these regions, but may be relatively common in a few areas, usually protected, such as Emas National Parks in the Cerrado (Godoi et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and Mirador State Park, where densities of 0.1–0.2 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> are reached (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).<br/><br/>In the Brazilian Pampas (southern portion of Rio Grande do Sul [RS] state), this felid is considered to occur only in well-preserved habitats areas (whose remaining area covers ca. 81,500 km²), and is always rarer than Geoffroy’s Cat.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and population decline is expected to be 14% in the next 21 years or three generations (assuming the same generation length of seven years). Because of this, the species was considered Vulnerable (C1) in Brazil (Queirolo et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The situation is thought to be the same in Uruguay.<br/><br/>An interesting point revealed by recent molecular studies is that the populations in RS state (Brazilian pampas) and Uruguay are genetically distinct from those present in the Brazilian Cerrado and also from Argentinean populations, indicating that they have been demographically isolated for a considerable period (Santos, Trigo and Eizirik, in preparation). Such a result indicates that this region constitutes a distinct conservation unit for this species, which should be taken into consideration when assessing its overall status.<br/><br/>In Peru, the Pampas Cat is generally uncommon or rare. A seemingly separate subpopulation of Pampas Cat occurs in the Tumbesian region of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. Individuals here are small and well-marked compared with the Andean form. This form inhabits mainly forested habitats, favoring dense vegetation along permanent water-courses and even in mangroves. It also occurs in agricultural fields, especially sugar cane plantations and in sparse desert habitats with little vegetation along the coast where shorebirds congregate. In this region, the high level of human impacts and settlement has resulted in widespread forest loss and the Pampas Cat is now extremely rare, being primarily found in protected areas.<br/><br/>Most of its subpopulations, which could in fact end up being considered as genetically different species, would be Vulnerable individually.",,Decreasing,"The Pampas Cat, named after Argentine grasslands, ranges throughout most of Argentina and Uruguay beyond into the dry forests (chaco, cerrado) of Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil, and north through the Andes mountain chain through Ecuador and possibly marginally into southwestern Colombia (Silveira 1995, Ruiz-Garcia et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Dotta et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>The suggestion by Pereira et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2002) that the species can be considered extinct in the Pampas of central Argentina has been confirmed by more recent surveys.<br/><br/>The most recent information indicates that this species is rare throughout a very large portion of its distribution range, such as the Patagonia, Monte, Espinal, Yungas, and Mesopotamia in Argentina, the Pampas and Pantanal in Brazil, the dry forests of Bolivia, as well as in Uruguay and Peru.","In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Perú people of Aymara origin, and in some cases Quechua, have similar beliefs regarding the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat (both known as titi or osqollo). A common tradition is the use of a skin or a stuffed cat during ceremonies that people perform for marking their domestic livestock, mainly llamas or alpacas; the titi is considered a sacred animal related with abundance and fertility of the livestock or quality of crops. It is important to note that both the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat are part of these traditions and beliefs, and in general, are used indistinctively. There are some local variations within and between countries and in some cases the influence of western culture has resulted in a total or partial loss of the values of Andean cultures and the distortion of ancestral customs regarding the titi (Villalba&#160;et al</em>. 2004).<br/>Cossios&#160;et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">.

This felid typically ranks first in felid abundance in several habitat types such as the dry forests of the Bolivian Chaco (Cuéllar et al.</em> 2006) and of the Argentine Espinal (Caruso et al.</em> 2012), scrublands of the Monte (Pereira et al.</em> 2011), relicts of the natural Pampas grasslands (Manfredi et al.</em> 2006), lowland cropland areas of the Andean subtropical forests (Di Bitetti et al.</em> 2011), and grasslands of southern Brazil (Trigo et al.</em> 2013). Its distribution range is considered to be continuous, but it does not occur in the high elevation areas (above 3,750  m) of the Andes. In the northern and central part of its range, this felid appears to have been favoured by the conversion of sub-tropical forests into croplands, while it seem to be tolerant to some degree of habitat alteration produced by livestock management. A recent expansion of its distribution has been documented in northeastern Argentina (Rinas et al.</em> 2014). However, it is considered rare in Chile, mostly because of its limited distribution in this country (Iriarte et al.</em> 2013) and Vulnerable in Rio Grande do Sul,  Brazil (Almeida et al.</em> 2013). Anthropogenic mortality (e.g. road-kills, persecution due to poultry predation) is intense in several areas (e.g., Pampas grasslands) and potential negative impacts from current trends in climate change have been proposed (Canepuccia et al. </em>2008, Pereira and Novaro&#160;2014). A hybrid zone between L. geoffroyi</em> and L. guttulus</em> was identified in southern Brazil where the two species meet (Trigo et al.</em> 2008, 2013b). These studies are currently indicating a possible natural origin for this event. In this case, this hybrid zone will be considered as an eligible process for conservation, by representing an important part of the evolutionary history of these species. However, specific studies are still needed to confirm this and evaluate whether anthropogenic influences such as human-induced changes in habitat or population densities in these areas could be influencing these hybridization events, and thus constituting a threat to these species by compromising their genetic integrity.","Described as occurring in a wide variety of habitat types of the subtropical and temperate Neotropics, including scrubby woodland, dry forests and savannas of the Chaco, Patagonian scrub, Monte desert/semi-desert, the Pampas grasslands, marshlands, etc. in both pristine and disturbed areas (Oliveira 1994, Pereira and Aprile 2012). It uses both open and closed habitats, but seems to be more associated with areas of denser cover in the predominately open areas of most of its range. Geoffroy's Cat is distributed throughout the pampas grasslands and arid Chaco shrub and woodlands, and up to 3,800 m in the Bolivian Andes (M. Da Silva pers. comm. 2014).  Most of its range is arid or semi-arid (Pereira et al.</em> 2006), but it also occurs in wetlands (e.g. Paraná River delta; Pereira et al</em>. 2005).  It is not found in either the tropical or temperate rainforests.  It is sympatric throughout most of its range with the Pampas Cat (L. colocolo</em>).<br/><br/>In a radiotelemetry study in wet pampas grassland of Argentina, Manfredi et al.</em> (2006) found mean home range size from 2.5-3.4 km², with male ranges 25%  larger than females.  In Chile's Torres del Paine National Park, in beech forest, home ranges were larger, at 2.3-6.5 km² for two females, and 3.9-12.4 km² for five males (Johnson and Franklin 1991).  In Argentina's Lihue Calel National Park, Pereira et al.</em> (2012) found male home ranges of 2-3 km²; whereas females occupied areas of 0.2-0.6 km². Home ranges in adjacent cattle ranches scaled up to 4.4 km² for males and up to 3.7-4.9 km² for females. During a severe drought  period in this same area, six radio-collared cats died of starvation when hare abundance fell from 5.6  to &lt;0.8 per 10 km (Pereira et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Manfredi et al.</em> (2004) found diet to vary by location in Argentina, consisting primarily of small rodent, but including other locally abundant species such as birds.  In Chile, rodents and hares were primarily taken (Johnson and Franklin 1991).  Plains Vizcachas are also prey (Branch 1995).  In southern South America, where Vizcachas have become extinct, introduced European Hares (Lepus europaeus</em>) are the major prey, although densities of both hares and Geoffroy's Cats were observed to decline markedly during a drought period (Pereira et al.</em> 2006).  Fish and frog remains were found in the stomachs of Geoffroy's Cats from Uruguay and Brazil (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  Bisceglia et al.</em> (2008) found that small mammals were the most frequent prey of Geoffroy´s Cats in Lihue Calel, representing at least the 63% of the food items throughout the year. <br/><br/>Geoffroy's Cat is a small solitary felid (4.3 kg), with an average litter size of 1.5 kittens, and predominantly nocturnal activity pattern. It seems to be the most abundant felid of the temperate Neotropics (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Lucherini et al</em>. 2006, Pereira and Novaro 2014).","Large numbers of pelts were exported from South America for the international fur trade from the 1960s to 1980s, but little trade took place after 1988 and the species was upgraded to CITES Appendix I in 1992 (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Cats are still killed as pests or poultry predators, and these pelts may be seen in local illegal trade. Currently, habitat loss and fragmentation, and retaliatory killing remains as the main threats. Potential negative impacts from current trends in climate change have been proposed (Canepuccia et al</em>. 2008, Pereira et al</em>. 2014)<br/><br/>During a health evaluation of Geoffroy´s Cats (Uhart et al.</em> 2012) at two different protected areas in Argentina (Campos del Tuyu Wildlife Reserve and Lihué Calel National Park), antibodies to infectious peritonitis, feline panleukopenia, canine distemper virus, feline callicivirus, toxoplasmosis and dirofilariasis were found in tested animals. Adult parasites recovered from necropsied animals and eggs in fresh faeces revealed the presence of various nematode families, including Ascarididae, Trichuridae, Capillariideae, Rictulariidae, Spiruridae and Ancylostomatidae; cestodes from families Taenidae and Anaplocephaliidae and oocists of Eimeriidae (Beldomenico et al.</em> 2005). These results suggest exposure (recent or past) to common domestic carnivore diseases, and indicate a potential risk to these Geoffroy´s Cats.<br/><br/>Human-related mortality accounted for most of Geoffroy’s Cat deaths recorded on cattle ranches near Lihué Calel National Park, with poaching, predation by dogs, and vehicle collision being the main causes of mortality (Pereira et al</em>. 2010).","It is relatively common throughout most of its range, although heavy commercial hunting pressure from the 1960s to the late 1980s is believed to have reduced populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The species was recently downgraded from Potentially Vulnerable to Least Concern in Argentina (Ojeda et al</em>. 2012). It is considered Rare in Chile (CONAMA 2009), occurring only in small areas in the south and east.  In Brazil, where the species inhabits only the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, it is considered Vulnerable (Almeida et al</em>. 2013), although relatively common and abundant in the pampas (T. Trigo pers. obs. 2014).

Most of the species area of occupancy is suffering from increasing&#160;landscape fragmentation due to logging, habitat conversion to pine plantations, agricultural and livestock activities. An annual forest loss rate of 4.5% per year (67% reduction of total forest area)&#160;for the period 1975-2000 was estimated for Chilean temperate rainforests. Future trends predict similar forest loss rates for the period 2010-2020. Given that vegetation cover is one of the most important ecological requirements for Guiñas, there is an evident threat through ongoing habitat deterioration and reduction. Evidence suggests landscape fragmentation is associated to reduced genetic diversity and population size decline. Also,&#160;various Guiña subpopulations may be going through a current size reduction, as inferred by a pattern of Ne &gt;&gt; N (bottleneck). Retaliatory killings for poultry predation&#160;and road kills are frequent death causes in fragmented landscapes, decreasing Guiña population numbers.&#160;In fragmented landscapes, Guiña home ranges are larger than in pristine areas and density is lower.&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">Emerging diseases&#160;facilitated by&#160;increased contact probabilities with domestic cats in fragmented landscapes, along with<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;climate change may also constitute important potential threats for Guiñas.&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Based on the best supporting evidence, this species qualifies for Vulnerable under criteria A2abc. Index of abundance used to apply Criteria A2a is based on DNA samples, camera-trapping and radio-tracking data.&#160;Index of abundance used to apply Criteria A2b followed data&#160;based on multiple lines of evidence as mentioned above. Data used to apply Criteria A2c is based on the decline in area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality as estimated on the annual forest loss rate of 4.5% per year for the period 1975-2000. Based on this estimate, a population decline of at least 30% is suspected&#160;in the past&#160;over three generations (18 years).&#160;We used realistic input data to estimate plausible lower and upper bounds for the total number of mature individuals,&#160;which range from&#160;5,980 to 92,092. Following the Red List Guidelines, we used a&#160;precautionary approach by considering the lower bound estimates. In the case of total number of mature individuals, the lower bound is &lt;10,000 individuals. For<strong>&#160;</strong>each subpopulation, four of the six geographic groups have ≤1,000 mature individuals. Based on the best supporting evidence, this species qualifies for Vulnerable under criteria&#160;C2a(i). However,&#160;if we use the higher population bounds, two of the six geographic groups with &gt;1,000 estimated mature individuals, or if the rate of decline is lower than suspected, Near Threatened may also be a possible category for Guiña.</span></span></p>","Vegetation cover is an important ecological requirement for Guiña, as it typically occurs in forest types with heavy understorey, probably used for dispersion, stalking prey and reproduction. In its northern range, the species is found associated to Mediterranean Matorral&#160;composed of&#160;sclerophyll&#160;forest and thicket.&#160;In its southern range, the species is strongly associated with moist temperate mixed forests of the southern Andean and Coastal ranges, particularly the Valdivian and Araucaria forests of Chile, which are characterized by the presence of Southern Beech (Nothofagus&#160;</em>spp.) and bamboo in the understorey.&#160;In Argentina, the species has been recorded in moist montane forest which has Valdivian characteristics, including a multi-layered structure with bamboo, numerous lianas and epiphytes (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Lucherini et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/>Guiñas are relatively tolerant to altered habitats, being found also in secondary forest, exotic pine and eucalyptus plantations, fragmented landscapes and on the fringes of rural settlements and agricultural areas (Sanderson et al.</em> 2002, Acosta-Jamett and Simonetti 2004). In central Chile,<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;guiña densities were lower in exotic pine plantations compared to primary native forest, and plantations were only used when close to native primary forests or regeneration understorey (Acosta-Jamett and Simonetti 2004).&#160;In southern Chile, where it is found in beech Nothofagus </em>forest, Freer (2004) found that areas of dense shrubby understorey (thicket-forest) were preferred over primary forest.&#160;In the highly modified human agricultural landscapes of northen Chiloé Island, Guiñas exclusively use vegetation corridors (as small as 3 m wide) to move among forest fragments, avoiding open areas (pastures with vegetation &lt;0.4-m high) (Sanderson et al.</em> 2002). The presence of these corridors is important to connect larger habitat areas, and is likely an important component of the species long-term persistence in human dominated landscapes (Sanderson&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2002, Acosta-Jamett&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2003, Acosta-Jamett and Simonetti 2007).&#160;Along with vegetation corridors, safe road crossing elements such as culverts, overpasses and underpasses are also important to favour Guiña connectivity in fragmented landscapes (Sanderson et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Guiñas display facultative, differential home range size, dispersal range and spatial overlap in relation to landscape features (Napolitano 2012, Napolitano et al.</em> submitted).&#160;In fragmented landscapes,&#160;home ranges are larger than in pristine areas and thus, density is lower. Home range size of Guiñas&#160;in the highly modified, fragmented landscape of northern Chiloé Island was 1.3-22.4 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Sanderson et al.</em> 2002), while in&#160;two pristine protected areas in the Aysén Region (Laguna San Rafael and Queulat National Parks) was 0.3-2.2 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Dunstone et al.</em> 2002). Maximum dispersal distances of Guiñas in fragmented landscapes was&#160;13.9 km (mean=5.5±4.9) (Sanderson et al.</em> 2002), while in protected areas was&#160;1.83 km (mean=1.49±0.25) (Dunstone et al.</em> 2002). Regarding spatial overlap, in fragmented landscapes Guiñas displayed exclusive intrasexual home ranges&#160;(females can be found within the range of males) (Sanderson et al.</em> 2002), while in protected areas extensive overlap of home ranges and core areas was observed (Dunstone et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Guiñas are agile hunters and mainly hunt on the ground. They fed primarily on small mammals, especially rodents, but also small marsupials, birds and reptiles are frequently taken (Correa and Roa 2005).  They scavenge opportunistically on carrion (Freer 2004).","Current main threats for guiñas include habitat loss and fragmentation, and direct persecution by humans.&#160;<br/><br/>Human population and deforestation are increasing in the Chilean temperate rainforest; In the northernmost part of its range, Guiñas inhabit the Chilean Matorral ecosystem, where more than half of the country’s total human population live and which has been dramatically reduced by habitat conversion to agricultural lands, leading to local extinctions and population fragmentation. Central and Lake District populations are suffering from extensive and intensive habitat loss and fragmentation by habitat conversion to&#160;pine plantations and&#160;logging of the remnant temperate Valdivian rainforest (Willson et al.</em> 2005, Echeverría et al.</em> 2006, 2008).&#160;On Chiloé Island, native forests have been largely cleared and fragmented over large areas to support domestic fowl, grazing and farming, leaving only remnants of the original forest surrounded by a human-modified matrix (Armesto et al.</em> 1998, Sanderson et al.</em> 2002).&#160;In its southernmost range, human density is lower, there is a greater amount of forest cover and agricultural lands are more frequently surrounded by a concentration of protected areas. An annual forest loss rate of 4.5% per year&#160;was estimated&#160;for the period 1975-2000&#160;in Chilean temperate rainforests&#160;(equivalent to 67% reduction of total forest area) (Echeverría et al.</em> 2006).&#160;These trends have not ceased and will continue into the future.&#160;Future trends predict similar forest loss rates for the period 2010-2020 (Echeverría et al.</em> 2008).&#160;Due to its restricted distribution and ecological requirements, the Guiña is especially vulnerable to increasing trends of habitat loss and fragmentation.<br/><br/>Evidence suggests that increased landscape fragmentation&#160;is associated with reduced genetic diversity&#160;in Guiñas&#160;(Napolitano et al.</em> submitted). Small population size would be the major force driving the decrease in genetic diversity of Guiñas inhabiting fragmented landscapes (e.g., low carrying capacity, local extinctions, road kills). This scenario is also supported by a&#160;pattern of Ne &gt;&gt; N found in various subpopulations throughout Guiña distribution range, showing they may be going through a current size reduction (i.e., genetic bottleneck) (Napolitano et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>On the other hand, most people in rural landscapes of central and southern Chile have negative attitudes<strong> </strong>towards Guiñas, arguing livestock and poultry losses (Herrmann et al.</em> 2013,&#160;Zorondo-Rodríguez et al.</em> 2014).&#160;81.4% of 43 families interviewed in a rural area of southern Chile considered Guiñas “damaging"" or ""very damaging”, although there was only a single recent report of a Guiña killing 12 hens in a henhouse (Silva-Rodríguez&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007). Illegal killing as retaliation for poultry depredation is the most likely outcome when a Guiña is caught within a chicken coup. On Chiloe Island, two out of seven radio-collared Guiñas were killed while raiding chicken coops (Sanderson&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2002).&#160;Retaliatory killings for poultry depredation accounted for 39.4% of the total 38 Guiña samples collected during a three-year study in Chiloé Island (Napolitano 2012, Napolitano et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>Guiñas also get killed by dogs and cars. Road kills are a major death cause, specially in fragmented landscapes, where they accounted for 29% of the total 38 Guiña samples collected during a three-year study in Chiloé Island (Napolitano 2012, Napolitano et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>Other threats include diseases and climate change; Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) infection was recorded in Guiñas and sympatric domestic cats in human perturbed landscapes on Chiloé Island, suggesting a possible interspecies transmission facilitated by increased contact probability through human invasion into natural habitats, habitat fragmentation and poultry attacks (Mora et al</em>. in press). On the other hand, climate change is also an important potential threat for Guiñas. It has been showed that the distribution range of Guiñas in Chile will decrease under climate change scenarios (Marquet et al</em>. 2010).","The total number of mature individuals inhabiting the distribution range was estimated. Given that most geographic areas throughout Guiña range are suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, we followed a precautionary but realistic approach and used density estimates for fragmented landscapes (0.77-0.05 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>). Using total surface area for each geographic group, we assumed exclusive home ranges, 80% of total area occupied (excluding urban areas, water bodies and wetlands) and 50% of the population being mature individuals.<br/><br/>Density estimates include:<br/><ul><li>Fragmented landscape in Chiloé Island, Chile: 0.77-0.05 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Sanderson et al</em>. 2002)</li><li>Pristine landscape in Laguna San Rafael and Queulat National Parks, Chile: 3.3-0.45 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Dunstone et al</em>. 2002).</li></ul><br/>Number of mature individuals estimated for each geographic group (lower and upper bounds):<br/>Northern group: 1,600-24,640 mature individuals<br/>Central group: 1,000-15,400 mature individuals<br/>Lake District group: 1,800-27,720 mature individuals<br/>Chiloé Island group: 180-2,772 mature individuals<br/>Argentinian group: 1,000-15,400 mature individuals<br/>Laguna San Rafael group: 400-6,160 mature individuals<br/>Total number of mature individuals: 5,980- 92,092 (lower bound &lt;10,000 individuals).",,Decreasing,"The Guiña, the smallest felid in the Americas, also has the smallest distribution, being found primarily in central and southern Chile&#160;(30°-48°S)&#160;and marginally in adjoining areas of southwestern Argentina (39°-46°S west of 70°W) from sea level to 2,500 meters. Its extent of occurrence is estimated at approximately&#160;300,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The Guiña occurs over most of its range, but&#160;its area of occupancy is fragmented due to loss of its native temperate forest habitat.&#160;A metapopulation approach estimated that there were 24 separate subpopulations in central Chile (Acosta-Jamett&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2003). On the eastern limit of the range, in Argentina, it is sympatric with the Geoffroy’s Cat (Lucherini&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2001). It is also found on the large island of Chiloe off the coast of southern Chile (Sanderson&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2002).<p>Two subspecies are recognized based on morphological and genetic data:<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;L. guigna tigrillo</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;(from 30°-38°S in Chile) inhabits mediterranean matorral and sclerophyll woodlands and forests in northern and central Chile and has a lighter coat and larger body size.<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;L. guigna guigna</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;(from 38°-48° in Chile and 39°-46°S in Argentina west of 70°W) inhabits more-dense Valdivian temperate rainforest and north Patagonian forest in southern Chile and the Andean Patagonian forest in southwestern Argentina and is darker and smaller (Napolitano et al.</em> 2014).</span></span></p>",,Terrestrial,"Included in CITES Appendix II and protected by national legislation in Argentina and Chile (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>Using a broad approach for population distinctiveness based on genetic and ecological exchangeability (Crandall et al.</em> 2000),&#160;two management units were proposed for the conservation of Guiñas, which correspond to the two identified subspecies&#160;(Napolitano et al.</em> 2014). Within these management units five genetic groups were identified, displaying significant variation on patterns of genetic diversity, biogeographic history and conservation threats among them.&#160;<br/><br/>Guiñas are recorded in 16 protected areas in Chile, but many are too small to support viable populations (Acosta-Jammett&#160;et al.</em> 2003). In Argentina, it is known from three national parks: Lanin, Nahuel Huapi and Los Alerces (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although densities may be low. The spatial extent of protected areas alone is not enough for the long-term viability of Guiña populations, thus incorporating private lands outside protected areas is crucial for Guiña conservation (Simonetti and Acosta-Jamett 2002, Acosta-Jamett et al.</em> 2003, Haines et al.</em> 2006, Gálvez et al.</em> 2013). This depends heavily on positive perceptions and attitudes of land owners and rural people towards Guiñas (Silva-Rodríguez et al.</em> 2007, Herrmann et al. </em>2013). Future conservation challenges for Guiñas outside protected areas will hinge on fostering positive attitudes of land owners towards Guiñas, increasing local awareness and participation to reduce conflict in areas where they are considered poultry pests, improving chicken coops and highlighting the services provided by its role as controller of mice carriers of Hanta virus and exotic European Hares (Lepus europaeus</em>) (Silva-Rodriguez et al.</em> 2007, Gálvez et al.</em> 2013, Napolitano et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Conservation efforts should focus on<strong>&#160;</strong>preserving vegetation corridors to facilitate connectivity between forest fragments or larger forested areas, along with providing safe road passages to decrease mortality by road kills (Dunstone et al.</em> 2002, Sanderson et al.</em> 2002, Gálvez et al.</em> 2013). Vegetation corridors are essential to maintain viable Guiña populations for their long-term survival&#160;in increasingly fragmented landscapes.<br/><br/>Further studies are required on the species ecology, demographics, natural history, and threats (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007). Priorities should be aimed at understanding the level of habitat loss and fragmentation at which the survival of the species is at risk. Regarding diseases, future studies should include elucidating the potential pathological effect and emerging disease risk&#160;Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)&#160;infections may have for Guiña populations.<br/><br/><br/><p><br/></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
54010576,54010476,Leopardus guttulus,Vulnerable,C1,2016,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Leopardus guttulus</em> has only recently been acknowledged as a valid species, separate from the former Leopardus tigrinus</em>, due to their genetic uniqueness and differences (Trigo et al.</em></em> 2013a). Its current northern limits of geographic distribution are still unclear, but show a large extent of occurrence of ca</em>. 3,287,075 km². However, its area of occupancy (AOO) is rather limited and within the threatened Cerrado and Atlantic Forest domains. Considering all available natural habitat in its entire range, the maximum AOO possible would be of only 473,254 km². Additionally, given the level of fragmentation and the very small size of some patches, it is very unlikely that the Southern Tiger Cat would be present in some parts of this remaining area. Besides, no single species occupies all natural areas within its geographic range. Therefore its actual AOO would be much lower than the estimates presented here. The species is almost always found at low/very low population densities (0.01–0.05/km² or lower), especially in protected areas, given the negative impact it suffers from Ocelots (‘ocelot effect’ – Oliveira et al.</em> </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, most of the population probably occurs outside protected areas, in places under severe pressure from land development/habitat conversion. A population decline in the past few years has also been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, the estimated density dropped from 0.25/km<sup>2</sup> to 0.13/km<sup>2</sup> by almost 50% from 2005 to 2013/14, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira et al</em>. 2008, 2013, Kasper et al.</em></em> 2016, M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). If this decline continues, a population reduction of 80% would be expected in three generations (15 years) in this area. In another area the estimated density dropped by over 50% from 0.2/km<sup>2 </sup>to &lt;0.1/km<sup>2</sup> from 2008 to 2015, resulting in a population reduction of over 7%/year. If this decline continues, the population would disappear in 3 generations in this area. Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, MMA/IBAMA 2011). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira et al.</em></em> 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012, R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comm.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between L. guttulus</em> and Leopardus geoffroyi</em> on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the southern tiger cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo et al.</em> </em>2008, 2013a). <br/><br/><br/>A declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of L. guttulus</em> was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (AOO) and typical lower population densities (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira et al.</em> </em>2010, 2013). Given the likely overestimation of the AOO, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. Based on the observed continuing decline in mature individuals of 50% and more in two important conservation areas for Leopardus guttulus</em> a continuing decline of over 10% over 15 years (= three generations) can be estimated. Due to its low estimated population size of less than 10,000 mature individuals and the high observed population reductions, the species may even qualify for Endangered in the near future.","The Southern Tiger Cat inhabits a broad variety of habitats. These range from dense tropical and subtropical rainforests, deciduous/semideciduous, and mixed pine forests, to the open savannahs, and beach vegetation, both pristine and disturbed (Tortato and Oliveira 2005; Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, 2013; Oliveira 2011). In the Pantanal (wet/swampy savannah) it is extremely rare and has been recorded only in the dry savannahs, not in the marshy areas. Although the Southern Tiger Cat can also inhabit disturbed formations, its occurrence near agricultural fields is, nevertheless, limited by the presence of natural cover. Thus, restricted to mosaics of forest or savannah and small-scale agriculture. In these areas, both telemetry information and scat analysis indicates that it uses the natural formations and does not venture deep into the agricultural areas per se</em>, but only on its borders, taking advantage of the high rodent densities (Facure-Giaretta 2002, Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The species is mostly found in lowland areas, reaching up to 2,000 m above sea level.<br/><br/>Litter size is usually one, sometimes two (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Diel activity pattern is predominantly nocturno-crepuscular, but with considerable amount of daytime activity. This activity during any time of the day is suggested to be a strategy to avoid predation by the larger sympatric Ocelot (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Prey base consists mostly of small mammals, birds and lizards, with average prey size at &lt;100 g, but does include larger sized prey (&gt;1 kg) (Facure-Giaretta 2002, Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Tortato 2009, Trigo&#160;et al.</em></em> 2013b). The limited information on home ranges shows that it is 2.5 times larger than they would be expected, based on the cat’s body size. This may be another consequence to avoid other larger and potential felid predators. Known home ranges for the Southern Tiger Cat range from 2 to 25 km² (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010).","The Southern Tiger Cat was heavily exploited for the fur trade decades ago, following the decline in Ocelot trade. Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. A population decline in the past few years has been detected in Santa Catarina state in Brazil, the area considered the most important for its conservation, where the density estimates dropped by more than 50%, probably as a consequence of prey reduction (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2013; M.A. Tortato pers. comm.). Additionally, the existing global population is still suffering from habitat loss and fragmentation, which in the case of the Cerrado biome is undergoing high rates of loss (Klink and Machado 2005, <span style="""">MMA/IBAMA 2011</span>). Other threats include hunting due to conflicts with rural owners, competition and diseases spread by domestic dogs, indiscriminate use of rodent poisoning, and road kills (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2013; Baréa and Leite 2012; R. Leite-Pitman and T. Trigo pers. comms.). It is also very important to consider the existence of an extensive hybridization zone between L. guttulus</em> and Leopardus geoffroyi</em> on the geographic limits of their distribution that may be affecting the genetic uniqueness of this species, as 38.2% of the Southern Tiger Cat specimens there are introgressed from the latter (Trigo et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Trigo et al.</em></em></em> 2013a).","Leopardus guttulus</em>&#160;population densities vary, but tend to be low throughout most of its range especially in regard to what would be expected of such a small cat species. Given its body size, expected density would be 91/100 km².&#160;&#160;Population densities of L. guttulus</em> vary from one to 25/100 km². It is generally around 1-5/100 km² (or even lower) in most of its area of occupancy but can get to 13-25/100 km² in a few isolated high density areas (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Higher densities are attained only where Ocelots are absent or very rare. Where Ocelots are common or attain densities of 10/100 km² or higher, the Southern Tiger Cat is extremely rare and is expected to reach numbers much lower than 1-5/100 km². Thus, the Southern Tiger Cat is negatively impacted by Ocelots by interspecific killing due to potential for competition in what is known as the “Ocelot effect” (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).<br/><br/>The state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil has been considered the most important area for Leopardus guttulus</em> conservation and thus to harbour the best and likely most viable population. This is due to the extent of the state’s remaining Atlantic Forest, level of connectivity and the cat’s presence in reasonable numbers in local Conservation Units due in most part to the absence of Ocelots (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Nevertheless, previous high densities found in some areas there (25/100 km²) seemed to have dropped to 13/100 km² or 7/100 km² in the past few years, likely as a consequence of natural rodent reduction (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, M. Tortato pers. comm.). Therefore, expected higher densities of this species might be lower than previously thought. Considering all remaining area of natural habitat there and the species densities recorded, population size in Santa Catarina is expected to be around 1,500–2,800 (more likely towards the lower limit). Elsewhere, population reductions of ca</em>. 67% have been observed due to an increase in number of Ocelots (Oliveira 2011, Marques 2013). At other areas, reductions from 20-24/100 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 8/100km<sup>2</sup>&#160;have also been noted (Oliveira 2011, Kasper et al.</em> </em>2015), but not as a consequence of the Ocelot effect.<br/><br/>Likely as a consequence of the Ocelot effect, L. guttulus</em> is found mostly outside protected areas of two of South America’s most threatened biomes, the highly fragmented Atlantic Forest, whose natural cover remaining is around 8% and the savannahs, whose remaining area is &lt;40%. In this way, conservation efforts should focus outside protected areas.<br/><br/>A declining global population of about 6,047 mature individuals of L. guttulus</em> was estimated, given its expected maximum area of occupancy (AOO) and typical lower population densities (Oliveira 2011; Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, 2013). Given the likely overestimation of the AOO, using the lower known density estimate values is warranted to compensate and avoid an unrealistic population overestimation. A future decline of 10–30% over the next 15-18 years (= three generations) is projected due to declining AOO (habitat loss) and habitat quality. Even though the Southern Tiger Cat is found in several protected areas, no conservation units within the species’ range in Brazil or elsewhere are expected to house 500 individuals, most far below 200 (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",,Decreasing,"The Southern Tiger Cat ranges from Central to southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina in the Provinces of Misiones and Corrientes. The species is absent from the Paraguayan Chaco. The northern limits of its geographic range are still unclear. It reaches Central Brazil in the states of Minas Gerais, Goiás, the border area of the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul state, and the Atlantic Forest area of eastern Bahia in the northeast region (T. de Oliveira pers. comm.).

50657407,15452,Leopardus jacobita,Endangered,C2a(i),2016,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most recent information confirms that the Andean Cat is a rare species, occurring at low densities and with a patchy distribution due to a specialization for rocky habitats.<br/><br/>New records of the Andean Cat in Argentina extended its distribution range to the south and outside the Andes, into Patagonian steppe and shrub habitats, at elevations as low as 650 m (Novaro et al.</em> 2010, Martinez et al.</em> 2008). However, a study of the population genetics of the Andean Cat throughout most of its range (Cossios et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the species has a very low mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity and identified two distinct Andean Cat populations that should be considered as two ""Evolutionary Significant Units” (ESUs), the highland cats from the previously-known distribution and the newly-discovered population in the Patagonian steppe. Moreover, the northern ESU contains two genetically different groups, showing limited or no exchange of individuals between them, which should be considered as two ""Management Units” (MUs).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation is an increasing concern in most areas where the Andean Cat is present, due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction, as well as water and soil contamination for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographical distribution (Bennett et al.</em> submitted) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Additionally, Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro et al.</em> 2010) and in northwestern Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (Lucherini and Merino 2008). More recently, information gathered from monitoring Andean Cats and Pampas Cats with GPS collars in north-western Argentina suggests that competition between these two species may affect negatively Andean Cat populations and make them more susceptible to the mentioned threats (Tellaeche 2015).<br/><br/>Based on Andean Cat distribution records an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1,530,818 km² was estimated. However, due to the specificity of Andean Cat to steep rocky environments, this area encompasses large areas between sites of records that are uninhabitable. In a preliminary estimation in a study area of 6,863 km² in Patagonia, only 1.4% of the total area was steep rocky areas. Additionally, in a study area of approximately 65,000 km² in Patagonia, only 3% of the cells in a grid size of 10x10 km were occupied, based on confirmed and unconfirmed Andean Cat records (Walker and Palacios, unpublished data).<br/><br/>This estimation can have more than one source of error (for example it uses still unconfirmed records) and was calculated for the Patagonian steppe, an environment that is different from that of the highland habitats in the northern and central part of the Andean cat distribution, where there is a greater proportion of rocky habitat. Therefore, to be conservative we estimated that 10% of the current EOO of the Andean Cat could actually be occupied.<br/><br/>Taking into account 10% of the EOO and the lowest density of 0.018 ind/km² (Huaranca et al.</em> 2013), estimated for a region considered to have one of the most favourable climatic conditions for the Andean Cat (Marino et al.</em> 2011), the total population of the Andean Cat is estimated at 2,755 individuals. Because no information about population structure is available, using a default value of 50% for the proportion of mature individuals within the Andean Cat population, only 1,378 would be mature individuals (see Table 1 in the Supplemental Material).<br/><br/>No information exists on trends with regard to habitat modification or destruction in the distribution area of the Andean Cat; but as early as 2002, the conservation status of the Patagonian Steppe and the Central Andean Puna were considered as Critically Endangered (CR) and Vulnerable (V), respectively, with habitat loss and fragmentation the most serious threats affecting their conservation status (Olson and Dinerstein 2002). There is no evidence that this situation has improved; an evaluation of the progress in the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 mentioned that most of the different habitats, including grasslands and wetlands, are still fragmenting and degrading (SCDB 2014).<br/><br/>Mining activities have increased and the associate use of water resources is impacting negatively most of the areas where the Andean cat presence has been confirmed; in the case of northern Argentinean Patagonia, fracking is an additional threat (Walker et al.</em> 2013). In Bolivia, mining is a priority activity and mainly situated in the Andean mountain range; extractive mining without environmental precautions is increasing (Ribera 2013). In Chile, mining industry is an important part of the country´s economy and is mainly developed in the northern region, where the Andean cat is distributed and water is a scarce resource. There, the fragile high Andean ecosystems are being degraded and a reduction of the wetlands is predicted in Chile because of the effects of climate change (IEB, CASEB, CCG-UC - CONAMA 2010). In the Peruvian report to the Biodiversity Convention, it is mentioned that in recent years the transformation of natural ecosystems has increased due to changes in land use, particularly by extractive activities such as mining; a trend of transformation, desertification and erosion is mentioned for the fragile wetlands and grasslands in the Peruvian Andes (Ministerio del Ambiente 2014).<br/><br/>Considering the threats to the Andean Cat, the natural fragmentation of the habitat and the increasing trend in fragmentation due to habitat loss and degradation, a continued decline of the population number is inferred.<br/><br/>Based on the available data on Andean Cat distribution and genetic analysis of samples from most areas, 10 subpopulations were identified for the Andean Cat (see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). Three subpopulations in Peru (1=north, 2=west, 3=east); two in Bolivia (4=north, 5=centre east); one subpopulation shared among south Peru, centre west Bolivia and northern Chile (6); one subpopulation shared among south-western Bolivia, centre east Chile and north-western Argentina (7); and three subpopulations in Argentina (8=north centre, 9= centre west and 10=southern west). Although some of these could be connected, more studies and more samples for genetic studies are needed.In the meantime, as a precautionary measure these 10 subpopulations are identified.<br/><br/>The estimate of the number of mature individuals for each subpopulation was made in the same way as for the estimation of the total number of mature individuals of the whole Andean cat species. The area of each subpopulation polygon was estimated using the Minimum Bounding Geometry, Convex hull function in ArcGIS. As these polygons are all occupied areas within the EOO, we did not reduce the area to 10% as we did for the overall range. However, even within these occupied areas, occupancy and habitat use by Andean cats is patchy, and they are constrained to rocky places associated with wetlands and/or shrublands. Thus, considering new detailed information on space use (Lucherini et al.</em> unpublished data, Huaranca unpublished data, Lagos unpublished data), we, estimated that only 40% of each subpopulation polygon is actually used by Andean Cats, and reduced the size of all polygons accordingly&#160;(see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The largest subpopulation is estimated to contain 172 mature individuals.<br/><br/>A further reason for concern about the conservation of this cat species, and for adopting a precautionary approach to its categorization is climate change. According to Bennett et al.</em> (submitted) the current bioclimatic distribution of the Andean Cat is clearly affected by climate change. By 2080, under the scenario A2 (medium to high emissions) the distribution area is expected to decrease between 15 and 30%, depending on the cut-off point used in the distribution model. Parallel to this, the model shows an increase in elevation in the north and central distribution, which puts the species even more at risk, because the environmental conditions at higher elevations do not provide the habitat requirements necessary for the Andean cat (Bennett et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>More studies are needed to confirm the definition of the subpopulations presented here and to improve our estimates of the population size of each one of them, but considering the precautionary principle, the analysis described above supports the classification of the Andean Cat as Endangered.","<p>The Andean Cat is found primarily in rocky and steep terrains, in arid and sparsely vegetated areas of the high Andes above the timberline, and in scrub and steppe habitats within the Andean foothills of Central Argentina and the Patagonian steppe ecological region (Napolitano<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008, Novaro et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010).&#160; In general, climatic conditions are extreme with very low temperatures, large daily thermal variations and low precipitation that determine the presence of adapted plants such as bunchgrasses, cushion plants, and low shrubs with small or resinous leaves (Cabrera and Willink 1973). The presence of high Andean wetlands known as “bofedales” and “vegas” is characteristic in the high Andes and are an important resource for wildlife and domestic animals (Villalba et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004).<br/> &#160;<br/> The Andean Cat distribution is similar to the historic range of the Short-tailed Chinchilla (Chinchilla chinchilla</em>) and current range of the mountain vizcacha (Lagidium</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> spp.) (Yensen and Seymour 2000), which are its major prey (Walker et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Napolitano et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008). According to the results of diet studies in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, and compared with that of other Andean carnivores, the Andean Cat occupies narrower niche with&#160; a wide overlap with the Pampas Cat diet (Walker et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Marino et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010). Rodents constitute the main prey item and the Mountain Vizcacha in three out of five diet studies was the more frequent prey: 52% and 43-53% in southern Bolivia and 44.1% in northern Chile (Viscarra 2008, Napolitano et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008, Torrico 2009). In a diet study with samples mostly collected in northern Argentina, unidentified small rodents were the most frequent prey (37.3%), followed by the mountain vizcacha 28% (Walker et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007); Tellaeche (2010) for a single locality in northern Argentina, also reported that small mammals were the item most frequently consumed by the Andean Cat (93.3% of the faeces), particularly rodents of the genus Phyllotis</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> (found in 76.9% of the samples). Among the Andean Cat prey items, the mountain vizcacha has the greatest body mass by far; consequently it contributes significantly to the Andean Cat diet (Walker et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Napolitano et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008).<br/> <br/> The Andean Cat is thought to be a solitary species, but may be seen in pairs or with kittens during the mating season and after the births of kittens respectively (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span lang=""EN-US"">et a<span lang=""EN-GB"">l</span></em>. 2004). Mating season, according to local people in Bolivia, is between July and August (Villalba and Bernal 1999); however, it is possible that this period could be much longer, because small cubs have been observed in October and from April to September (Villalba 2002, Villalobos<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. In prep., Lucherini Unpublished data). Two kittens were seen by Villalba (2002), and what appears to be an older single cub by Sorli <span lang=""EN-US"">et al.</em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">(2006).<br/> <br/> Most of the reported sightings of Andean Cats have been during daytime; however the radio-tracking of the first radio-collared Andean Cat in southern Bolivia recorded main activity peaks at dusk or at night, between 18:00 and 23:00 hours (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009); similarly the results of 1,596 camera-trap photos from different localities in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile showed the following proportions for Andean Cat activity: 37.6% at night, 34.4% crepuscular, and 28% during the day (Lucherini et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009). Additionally, the results indicated that the Andean Cat activity overlaps largely with that of the mountain vizcacha, a diurnal and crepuscular species (Galende <span lang=""EN-US"">et a<span lang=""EN-GB"">l</span></em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 1998).<br/> <br/> Data on territoriality is absent, however, as occurs with most felids (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), it is possible that male territories are larger than those of females and that there could be a certain degree of territory overlap between the sexes. Because the conditions of the Andean Cat habitat are severe and naturally fragmented, it is probable that territory and home ranges are very large; a radio-tracked female Andean Cat, between April and December 2004, had a home range of 65.5 km² (95% minimum convex polygon: Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""> The Andean Cat is a medium-sized felid; from measures of skins the total length in adults varies from 740 to 850 mm and in sub-adults varies from 577 to 600 mm; tail length is from 410 to 485 for adults and 330 to 420 mm for sub-adults. Only two records on the weight are available, the first from a sub-adult specimen from Peru, which weighed 4 kg (Pearson 1957, García-Perea 2002) and the second is from an adult female from Bolivia which weighed 4.5 kg (Delgado et al.</em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2004).<br/> <br/> Andean Cat fur is mainly ash grey with brown-yellowish blotches that are distributed as vertical lines at both sides of the body, giving the appearance of continuous stripes. The tail of the Andean cat is very characteristic. It is very long (66 - 75% of the head and body length), thick and cylindrical, with a fluffy aspect and with 6 to 9 wide rings of dark brown to black colour (García-Perea 2002). The legs also have dark and narrower blotches or stripes, but they don’t form complete rings.<br/> <br/> Apparently the species is not sexually dimorphic in terms of fur colour, but comparisons among Andean Cat skulls carried out by García-Perea (2002) suggest that sexual dimorphism is present. Differences between juvenile and adult specimens were also found, with juveniles having a lighter coloration and more and smaller blotches (García-Perea 2002). Because of these features, sub-adult or juvenile Andean Cats can be confused much more easily with Pampas Cats (García-Perea 2002).<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>In the early 2000s the Andean Cat Alliance considered traditional hunting the top threat, followed by prey reduction and habitat loss and fragmentation (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004), four years later a re-evaluation of the threats affecting the Andean Cat, established that habitat loss and habitat degradation are the main current threats; hunting (opportunistic/palliative or traditional) and reduction of prey populations are considered as the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> threats, in order of importance (ACA 2011: Andean Cat Alliance Strategic Plan).<br/> <br/> Expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe are altering the Andean Cat habitat. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographic distribution (Bennett<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. in progress) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2013).<br/> <br/> Hunting by local people who consider the Andean Cat a predator of their small domestic livestock has been frequently reported particularly in some regions of Argentina, Chile and Peru (Iriarte 1998, Cossíos and Madrid 2003, Lucherini and Merino 2008). Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010). These cats are also killed by dogs accompanying local shepherds and in north-western Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (C. Tellaeche and M. Lucherini unpub. data). Cossios et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2007) also reported the hunting of Andean and Pampas Cats for food and for traditional medicine in central Peru.<br/> <br/> Particularly in Bolivia, Peru and northern Chile, the Andean Cat (as well as the Pampas Cat) is considered a sacred animal according to indigenous Aymara and Quechua traditions. Throughout much of its range, dried and stuffed specimens are kept by local people for use in harvest festivals (Iriarte 1999, Sanderson 1999,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004, Cossios et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Villalba et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Hunting for such cultural practices may represent a significant threat to the species.<br/> <br/> The Short-tailed Chinchilla was likely to have been a major prey species for the Andean Cat, but the species was hunted nearly to extinction for the fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In most of its range, the main prey of the Andean Cat is now the Mountain Vizcacha (Walker et al</em>. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Napolitano et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Torrico 2009), which lives in patchily distributed small colonies and has also been reduced by hunting pressure. This may result in a highly fragmented distribution for the Andean Cat. Intra-guild competition, especially with the Pampas Cat, for Mountain Vizcacha prey, could negatively impact the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2003, Walker et al.</em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2007, Reppucci 2012).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>Until now three population estimates on Andean Cat were carried out. Napolitano<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2008), based on genetic sampling estimated five individuals to occur in a 25,000 ha area in northern Chile, around the Salar de Surire National Monument, resulting in a density of two Andean Cats in 100 km². More recent estimates based on systematic camera trapping resulted in 7-12 Andean Cats in 100 km² in northwestern Argentina (Reppucci et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011) and in central western Bolivia, a preliminary estimate of 1.8 Andean cats in 100 km² was calculated by dividing the minimun number of identified Andean Cats by the area covered (164 km²) (Huaranca et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2013). In the last two studies, densities of sympatric Pampas Cats were also estimated, resulting 74-79 Pampas Cats in 100 km² in Argentina and 4.9 Pampas Cats in 100 km² in Bolivia. Reppucci et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2011) also estimated the detection probabilities for both species, which were higher for Andean Cat (0.07) than Pampas Cat (0.02). Other studies based mainly on faecal sample collection have found records of the Pampas Cat much more frequently than the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Vidal 2003, Perovic et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2003, Cossios et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Torrico 2009, Novaro et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Villalba et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). All this information confirms that the Andean Cat is much rarer than the Pampas Cat.<br/> <br/> The three surveyed areas outlined above are located within the two regions that are considered to have the most favourable climatic conditions for Andean Cat, and that coincide with those places where a larger number of Andean Cat records have been obtained (Marino<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011). In this context, it is expected that Andean Cat density in those areas with less favourable conditions will be much lower.<br/> <br/> A study of the population genetics of the Andean cat throughout most of its range (Cossios<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em>. 2012) indicated that the species has a very low mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity and two distinct Andean Cat subpopulations,which are latitudinally separated between 26 and 35° S,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">were identified that should be considered as two ""Evolutionary Significant Units” (ESUs). Moreover, the northern ESU contains two genetically different groups, showing limited or no exchange of individuals between them, which should be considered as two ""Management Units” (MUs).<br/> <br/> The geographical separation between the northern and southern ESU concurs with the third biogeographic barrier, the South American Arid Diagonal and the separation between the two northern management units coincides with the transition zone between the wet and dry Puna (Cossíos et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </em>2012); thus, the authors remark that these three groups of Andean Cat populations could have developed special adaptations because significant differences exist in rainfall patterns over this range.<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",,Decreasing,"<p>The Andean Cat has a patchy distribution due to a specialization for naturally fragmented rocky habitats and most presence records are from the central Andes above 3,600 meters in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. However it has also been found at lower elevations in the southern Andes of Argentina at 1,800 m (Sorli<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2006) and more recent records of the Andean Cat in Argentina and Chile extend its distribution range to the south and outside the Andes, into Patagonian steppe and scrub habitats in Argentina, at elevations as low as 650 m (Novaro et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Martinez et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008), and at 2,200 m in Chile in the Atacama Region (Villalobos et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. in prep.).<br/> <br/> Within the high Andes the Andean Cat was recorded at an average elevation of 4,236 m in Argentina (Perovic<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2003), above 3,800 m in Bolivia (Villalba et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012), between 3,714 and 4,414 m in Chile (Napolitano et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008), and at 4,000 m or higher in Peru (Cossios et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007).<br/> <br/> Until the end of the nineties, Andean Cat records were scarce and restricted to southern Peru, southwest Bolivia, northwest Argentina and northern Chile (Yensen and Seymour 2000). Similarly, sightings of this species were very few (Scrocchi and Halloy 1986, Sanderson 1999), and museum specimens were equally few (Garcia-Perea 2002). However in the last two decades the number of distribution records has greatly increased due to the efforts of the Andean Cat Alliance (<a href=""http://www.gatoandino.org"">www.gatoandino.org</a>), a network of specialist researchers.<br/> <br/> Currently the known northern and southern limit for the Andean cat respectively is central Peru (10°13'S), and central Argentina (38°23'S) (Cossios<span class=""apple-converted-space""> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Novaro et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010), but throughout this range the Andean Cat populations are patchily distributed. The results of modelling the Andean Cat distribution considering four bioclimatic variables (annual mean and mean diurnal range temperature, annual precipitation, and coldest season winter), shows the presence of three biogeographic barriers that affect the species’ distribution: i) at the north in Peru that coincides with the Huancabamba depression, known as “Peruvian low” and defines the northern boundary of its distribution range, ii) at the centre in Bolivia, with the “Andean knee”, an extremely arid transition zone between the wet and dry Puna and where there are no records of Andean cats, and iii) at the south with the “Arid Diagonal” in Chile and Argentina, that is also an hyper-arid zone and with very few records of Andean Cats (Marino et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011).<br/> <br/> According to this model and despite the differences in elevation over the current geographic range of the Andean Cat, there are common climatic conditions that favour for their presence, which are cold, dry and extreme diurnal variations in temperature (Marino et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </em>2011).<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>","In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Perú people of Aymara origin, and in some cases Quechua, have similar beliefs regarding the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat (both known as titi or osqollo). A common tradition is the use of a skin or a stuffed cat during ceremonies that people perform for marking their domestic livestock, mainly llamas or alpacas; the titi is considered a sacred animal related with abundance and fertility of the livestock or quality of crops. It is important to note that both the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat are part of these traditions and beliefs, and in general, are used indiscriminately. There are some local variations within and between countries and in some cases the influence of western culture has resulted in a total or partial loss of the values of Andean cultures and the distortion of ancestral customs regarding the titi (Villalba et al</em>. 2004).<br/>Cossios&#160;et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">.

97212355,11509,Leopardus pardalis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Ocelot has a wide distribution, from northern Argentina to the southwestern United States, being the most common felid species in most of the tropical and subtropical habitats of the Neotropics; it is listed as Least Concern. Densities seem to increase with rainfall and decrease with latitude, with the highest densities in tropical areas (Di Bitetti et al.</em> 2008). Even though there are indications of specific population declines, these do not seem to affect the species to the point of categorizing it under any threat category rangewide. Its extensive occurrence in Brazil, added to the remaining area of present distribution allows an effective population of &gt;40,000 mature individuals (Oliveira et al.</em> 2013). At least in some areas of the Amazon basin, populations are apparently healthy and stable. The species is, nevertheless, impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, intense logging activities, vehicle collisions and poaching (Di Bitetti et al.</em> 2008, Payan et al.</em> 2013). In Colombia, Ocelots manage to survive in oil palm landscapes and extensive cattle ranches in the llanos and Inter-Andean valleys (Boron and Payan 2013, Diaz-Pulido and Payan 2011). In Argentina, the species still is found in all the subtropical area and although it is affected by poaching and logging (Di Bitetti et al.</em>&#160;2006, 2008, 2010), a total of 1,500 to 8,000 individuals is estimated for this country at the southern range of the species (Aprile et al.</em> 2012). Populations of northeastern Mexico and Texas have experienced dramatic declines and the genetic impacts of isolation are apparent, particularly in Texas (Janecka et al.</em> 2011 and Janecka et al.</em> 2014). The number of Ocelots in Texas is believed to be between 50 – 80 individuals. These areas will certainly need attention or Ocelots are likely to be extirpated there.","The species occupies a wide spectrum of habitats types, ranging from scrublands to tropical rain forests. What all these habitats have in common is a well-structured vegetation cover (Emmons 1988, Emmons et al.</em></em></em> 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Ocelots were recorded in mangrove forests, coastal marshes, savanna grasslands, thorn scrubs, and tropical and subtropical forest (primary, secondary, evergreen, seasonal and montane). The species typically occurs at elevations below 3,000 m but there are occasional reports of the species up to 3,000 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>The Ocelot is a medium sized felid (11 kg), with a litter size of 1.4 kittens (1–4), and typically nocturno-crepuscular activity, but that could also be active during daytime (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Di Bitetti et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Throughout much of its range tends to be the most abundant cat species. The Ocelot also reaches higher density estimates than its sympatric smaller species and was suggested that also negatively impact its small guild members (Di Bitetti et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira et al.</em></em></em> 2010). The species use similar habitat and show similar abundance patterns than Jaguars and Pumas and appear not to be affected by these species (Di Bitetti et al 2010, Davis et al.</em></em></em> 2011)&#160; Its diet includes small mammals, birds and reptiles, but include also larger sized prey (&gt;800 g), such as agoutis, armadillos, pacas, monkeys, etc. that in some areas can constitute the most important items (Crawshaw 1995, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Moreno et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Bianchi et al.</em></em></em> 2010)<br/><br/>The home ranges of males are larger than the ranges of the sympatric females, but high variation exist on the size between regions (Dillon and Kelly 2008).&#160; The largest home ranges (43 km² for males and 16 km² for females) were observed in Subtropical forest of Brazil and Argentina (Crawshaw 1995) and the smallest (2 to 6 km² for males and 1 to 3 km² for females) were observed in Texas (US), Brazilian Pantanal, Peruvian Amazonia and Bolivian Chaco (Navarro 1985, Emmons 1988, Crawshaw and Quigley 1989, Laack 1991, Maffei and Noss 2008).","At present the major threats for the species are habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry and illegal trade of pets and pelts (Sunquist and Sunquiest 2002).The Ocelot has been described as being tolerant in some degree to habitat disturbs and persists in wooded patches near human settlements. However, Ocelot abundance is negatively affected by anthropogenic effects like poaching and logging (Di Bitetti et al.</em></em> 2008). Although widespread commercial harvests for the fur trade ceased decades ago, some illegal trade still persists.","Ocelot population densities throughout its entire range varies widely from 2.5 to 160/100 km². At a continental scale, Ocelot densities decrease with latitude and increase with rainfall (Di Bitetti et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). Primary productivity seems to determine the abundance of this wild cat across their range, but at a local scale their abundance may be affected by logging and poaching or by competition with other species (Di Bitetti et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008). The lowest densities are found at the Pine Forest of Belize (Dillon and Kelly 2007), dry areas of Mexico (Gonzalez et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003) and the Caatinga in northeastern Brazil (Oliveira 2012). The maximum estimated density was found at the Barro Colorado Island in Panamá (Rodgers et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The species is considered Endangered in Mexico (Norma Oficial Mexicana 2010) and in United States (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2010), Vulnerable in Colombia (Rodriguez-Mahecha et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006) and Argentina (Aprile et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In Brazil, populations outside the Amazon are listed as Vulnerable (Machado et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).",,Decreasing,"The Ocelot is widely distributed from United States and Mexico through Central and South America south to North Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay, found in every country except Chile.&#160; In the United States was recorded in Arizona (Strangl and Young 2011, Avilas-Villegas and Lamberton-Moreno 2012) and in two isolated subpopulations in the southern tip of Texas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2010).

50653881,54012637,Leopardus tigrinus,Vulnerable,A2c,2016,2016-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Leopardus tigrinus</em> has recently been split into two species: L. tigrinus </em>and L. guttulus</em> (Trigo et al. </em>2013a). The present concept applies only to the former, distributed from North Eastern Brazil through the majority of northern South America to what seem as disjunct populations in Panama and the Central Cordillera of Costa Rica (Hunter and Barrett 2011, Trigo et al.</em> 2013a). L. tigrinus</em> and L. guttulus </em>show no evidence of ongoing gene flow, whereas L. tigrinus</em> and Pampas cat (L. colocolo</em>) have not developed complete intrinsic reproductive barriers, which has allowed them to hybridize (Trigo et al.</em> 2013a). Furthermore, there is also considerable evidence that the Central American population, suggested as L. t. oncilla</em> also represents a different species (Johnson et al.</em> 1999, Trigo et al.</em> 2008). Leopardus tigrinus</em> is widespread and rare everywhere, including their reported habitats to date: Andean montane and mist forests, Central American forests, Amazon forests, Rupununi Savannas and, Brazil’s Cerrado and Caatinga domains (Moreno et al.</em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, Oliveira et al.</em> 2013). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, densities are also very low, typically around 0.01–0.05/km<sup>2</sup> (Oliveira et al. </em>2010, 2013). In the Amazon, the species' occurrence might be marginal and restricted to some small isolated enclaves. The Northern Tiger Cat was absent from all of the extensive camera-trap studies that totalled 56,837 trap-days throughout all of the Amazon Basin and was considered the rarest carnivore there (Oliveira et al</em>. unp. data). Abundance estimates of this small felid are lower than that reported for the much larger jaguar, puma and ocelot, and there is evidence suggestive of population fluctuations or declines of unknown reasons, in some areas, estimated at 10–40% (Oliveira 2011, unp. data). It has been suggested that high Ocelot population numbers negatively affect the Northern Tiger Cat population (Oliveira et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Probably most of the population of L. tigrinus</em> occurs outside protected areas, and outside the Amazon basin lowland rainforest (Oliveira 2011), in habitats which are undergoing variable rates of loss due to habitat conversion to agriculture. Extreme examples include the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga (with losses of 50% or more depending on the source; Klink and Machado 2005, IBAMA/MMA 2011a, CI 2012) and the Brazilian Amazon (with deforestation of more than 20%/10,000km<sup>2</sup>/yr in recent years; Morton et al. </em>2006) and an overall loss of 90% of cloud forest in the northern Andes (Bubb et al.</em> 2004, Garavito et al. </em>2012). Loss of habitats from conversion to agricultural lands is certainly its main threat to survival also in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and the deforestation frontier of the Amazon basin. Other threats include retaliatory hunting from depredation on poultry and the skin and pet trade, competition and disease spread by domestic dogs, and road kills (Oliveira et al. </em>2013, Marinho 2015). There is also hybridization with Pampas Cat in central/northeastern Brazil, which may be a natural or anthropogenic process whose extent as a threat is unknown (Trigo et al</em>. 2013a). If further taxonomic species splits are indeed confirmed, the sub-populations are to be even smaller.&#160;High rates of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation in Brazil (Klink and Machado 2005, Morton et al. </em>2006) depict habitat suppression, not degraded habitat, which should reflect equivalent species population declines, for example. The estimated species area of occupancy (AOO) for subspecies L. t. tigrinus</em> and L. t. pardinoides</em> was estimated from 893,200 to 1,020,800 km<sup>2</sup> of the total current available habitat (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). This includes applying a 20–30% reduction to compensate for inclusion of tiny fragments (which were considerable in many Areas; IBAMA/MMA 2011 a,b). A Population in semi-arid Caatinga scrub/dry forest mosaic area in Bahia State, Brazil, showed an observed abundance reduction of 25.9% from 2012 to 2015 (L. P. de Castro Meira, T. G. de Oliveira, pers. comm.). The decline of the Northern Tiger Cat over three generations was modelled with a maximum entropy algorithm for 52 Leopardus tigrinus</em><span id=""yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1466593628142_10605""> records in Colombia and 19 bioclimatic variables and found a 12.7% population loss over three generations for the species (i.e. 15 years). The decline for Brazil, which holds the majority of the species range, was estimated at 36.8% in three generations (Oliveira et al. 2013, MMA/IBAMA 2014). Including a stable population for Central America the&#160;overall reduction&#160;is estimated to&#160;be 31.7%. The species is therefore classified as Vulnerable VU A2c. The overall range-wide population size is estimated to be less than 10-11,000 individuals, the species will continue to decline, and there is a lack of conservation actions destined to the species.</p>","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, from the lowland semi-arid Caatinga to cloud forests in the Andes. In Costa Rica the species is almost entirely confined to montane forests along the flanks of volcanoes and other high mountains from 1,000 m up to the treeline (paramo) and occupy cloud forest and high elevation elfin forests (J. Schipper pers. comm.). Their distribution pattern in Costa Rica and Panama closely resembles that of the oak (Quercus</em> sp.) dominated forests (J. Schipper pers. comm.). While in Central America and parts of northern South America it may be most common in montane cloud forest, it is mostly found in lowland areas in Brazil, being reported from rainforests to dry deciduous forest, savannahs, semi-arid thorny scrub, in both pristine and disturbed areas. However, the species appears absent in the llanos but present from a few records from Rupununi savannahs in Guyana (Payán pers. obs.). In disturbed habitats, it can occur even close to human settlements, as long as there is natural cover and prey base (Oliveira et al. </em>2008). However, Marinho (2015) has shown that the species' occurrence is favoured by denser woody cover and distance from rural settlements in the dry Caatinga of northeast Brazil. Although it can be found in a few and localized areas of the Amazon Basin (Oliveira 2004), the use of lowland Amazonian forests is practically unknown and requires research attention. After an enormous effort of 56,837 camera trap-days, at 12 different study sites throughout the Basin, no record of the species was obtained (Oliveira et al.</em> unp. data).<br/><br/>The Northern Tiger Cat is a poorly known small-sized (2.4 kg) solitary felid, with an average litter size of 1.12 kittens (1–4) (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Diel activity pattern is mostly nocturno-crepuscular, but with considerable amount of daytime activity. However, it could also be highly diurnal in some areas of Brazil. Leopardus tigrinus</em> diet is still very poorly studied, but is known to be based on small mammals (&lt; 100 g; Trigo et al. 2013b), birds and reptiles (especially lizards). Limited data on home range shows that they are much larger than would be expected by its small body size. It ranges from 1 to 17 km² (Oliveira et al. </em>2010). Northern Tiger Cats are typically rare to uncommon, occurring at low population densities throughout most of its range, especially on what would be expected by a felid of its size. Densities are typically 1-5/100 km², but can reach 15-25/100 km² in a few and localized areas where ocelots are either rare or absent (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira et al. </em>2010). Its numbers/densities are strongly negatively impacted by the larger Ocelot, its potential intraguild predator/competitor (Oliveira et al. </em>2008, 2010; Oliveira 2011).","The Tiger Cats were heavily exploited for the fur trade decades ago, following the decline of the Ocelot trade (Payan and Trujillo 2006). Although international trade ceased, there is still some localized illegal hunting, usually for the domestic market. Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, disease, road-kill, illegal trade (pets and pelts), retaliatory killing due to depredation of poultry (Oliveira et al. </em>2008, 2013; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; Diaz-Pulido et al.</em> 2013; Marinho 2015). By and large, the greatest threat is the rampant rate of habitat loss, fragmentation and isolation. In the Andes cloud forests deforestation is mostly due to conversion to agriculture but also includes oil, hydroelectric dams, urban sprawl and road building (Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, CI 2012). In the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga, suppression to agriculture is by far the main threat. In these domains the rate is actually higher in the area called MATOPIBA (the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí and Bahia), where it is twice as high as in the other parts of the country and which also comprises the main and most important area for the species (IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Oliveira 2011). Thus, populations in the core range area of Leopardus tigrinus </em>range are getting ever increasingly reduced and fragmented. Change in native species dynamics (predator/competitor) could represent another previously undetected potential threat (Oliveira 2011, Oliveira et al</em>. 2013). Hybridization with Pampas cat in all of northeast and central Brazil (the main range area for L. t. tigrinus</em>) was detected in 100% of all specimens evaluated. This may be a natural or anthropogenic process and the extent of this as a threat is unknown (Trigo et al.</em> 2013a), but would probably already compromise about 70-80% of the entire species population, or even more. This high level of hybridization is unheard of for any extant cat species.","Relative abundance and estimated population densities vary greatly, and the northern Leopardus tigrinus </em>is less abundant than the southern Leopardus guttulus </em>and also the rarest of the tropical species of Neotropical cat (Oliveira 2011). Leopardus tigrinus </em>is rare everywhere, including their reported habitats to date: Andean montane and cloud forests, Central American forests, Amazon forests, Rupununi Savannahs and, Brazil’s Cerrado and Caatinga domains (Moreno et al.</em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011, Oliveira et al.</em> 2013). In the Amazon, density is very low, expected at approximately 0.01/100 km². Camera-trap surveys in other portions of its range indicate that the species generally occurs in densities between 1-5/100 km² or lower (Oliveira et al.</em> 2010, 2013). In Central America the species rarely shows up in camera traps even where they are known to occur, suggesting that they either avoid traps or are naturally rare and elusive in that area (Schipper pers. comm.). A similar trend is also found in several areas in Brazil, where authors found it in most areas in intrinsically low numbers, and apparently those numbers are not owed to camera-trap shyness (Oliveira pers. comm.). The species was absent from all extensive camera-trap studies in the llanos of Colombia and all of the Amazon, depicting its extreme rarity there (Oliveira, Payán pers. comm.). The Northern Tiger Cat is negatively impacted by Ocelot numbers and does not seem to attain effective population size for long term persistence in any Conservation Unit possibly due to the “Ocelot effect” (Oliveira et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). It seems that where Ocelots are rare or absent the average population density of tiger cats ranges from 5-20 ind./100 km² but expected to be much lower than 5/100 km² where Ocelots are present (high density estimates, ca. 20/100 km², are obtained only in very few and isolated areas) (Oliveira et al. </em>2010, Oliveira 2011). Leopardus tigrinus</em> is classified as Vulnerable in Colombia (MAVDT 2005, Rodriguez-Mahecha et al. </em>2006) and as Endangered in Brazil (IBAMA/MMA 2014). The estimated species area of occupancy (AOO) for subspecies L. t. tigrinus</em> and L. t. pardinoides</em> was estimated from 893,200 to 1,020,800 km²&#160;of the total current available habitat (Oliveira et al. </em>submitted, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). This includes applying a 20–30% reduction to compensate for inclusion of tiny fragments (which were considerable in many areas) (IBAMA/MMA 2011 a,b). Extrapolated population estimation based on the above distribution estimates and also estimated densities (0.01/km²), results in an expected total population size ranging from 8,932 to 10,208 adult individuals. Decline based on deforestation rates of the species’ habitat is certainly above 10% over the next decades (Morton et al.</em> 2006, Mulligan 2010, Garavito et al.</em> 2012). It seems that the savannahs of Mirador State Park and the complex of protected areas around Nascentes do Rio Parnaíba National Park in the Brazilian mid-north and the Andean protected areas in Colombia are the most important areas for the species conservation (Oliveira et al.</em> 2008, 2014; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011).",,Decreasing,"The distribution range of the Northern Tiger Cat expands from Costa Rica and Panama in Central America into South America up to Central Brazil. Its southern limits are not yet well known, as well as the extent of a possible overlap with the populations of the Southern Tiger Cat (L. guttulus</em>) (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). Furthermore, there is also considerable evidence that the Central American population, suggested as L. t. oncilla </em>also represents a different species (Johnson et al.&#160;</em>1999, Trigo et al. </em>2008). Additionally, it is also possible that the northern South American population, described as L. t. pardinoides,</em> will also comprise a separate species (Nascimento 2010), or be together with L. t. oncilla</em>. from northwestern South America a clearly distinctive species from L. t. tigrinus</em> (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). There are records from the Amazon basin, but the distribution could be discontinuous and patchy, and the species extremely rare (Oliveira 2004). L. tigrinus</em> has been described as one of the rarest species in Amazonia, being absent in all of the 12 extensive camera-trap studies assessed along all of the basin. Its occurrence there might be marginal and restricted to some enclaves (Oliveira unp. data). The species is absent from the Llanos (Payan et al.</em> 2007) and from the Darien Peninsula connecting Central and South America. From Ecuador and Peru only few museum specimens exist and only in 2000 the species was formally confirmed in Bolivia through live-trapping. Although the Northern Tiger Cat has been collected as high as 4,800 m (Cuervo et al. </em>1986), this is probably an outlier, as there are very few records at or slightly above 3,000 m (T. Oliveira pers. comm.). However, in Costa Rica, in the Chirripó National Park, the species was recorded at 3,625 m (González-Maya and Schipper 2008).&#160;In Colombia it seems to be restricted to elevation above 1,500 m, however in Brazil most of the records were below 500 m (Oliveira et al</em>. 2008). It seems that the bulk of the species' distribution would be the cloud forests of Costa Rica for L. t. oncilla</em>, at 1,500-3,000 m in the northern Andes for L. t. pardinoides</em>, and the dry-lands of the Cerrado and Caatinga domains and adjacent deciduous forest in north-central Brazil for L. t. tigrinus</em>. All other areas seem to be marginal for the species (Oliveira unp. data/in prep.). Although the extent of occurrence is rather broad, the actual area of occupancy (AOO) is considerably restricted, especially because large portions of the high Andes, or of the Brazilian Cerrado (ca. 50%) and Caatinga (ca. 46%) have already been suppressed and converted to agriculture-pasture, where the species is known to be absent (Klink and Machado 2005; Oliveira et al.</em> 2008; IBAMA/MMA 2011a, b; Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011; CI 2012). Thus, based on and using the remaining available cover estimates as the expected AOO (and compensating for inclusion of unsuitable areas and the tiny fragments), should be somewhere around 893,200–1,020,800 km<sup>2</sup>, and is continually declining (Morton et al. </em>2006, Mulligan 2010). Additionally, if the Northern Tiger Cat tends to avoid the more open formations and proximity to rural settlements as Marinho (2015) reported for the Caatinga and Oliveira et al</em>. (2014) noticed for the Cerrado, then the ""de facto"" AOO should be even smaller.",,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. Hunting of the species is prohibited in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Suriname and Venezuela (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the Amazon, field records suggest that, where found, populations are extremely low - therefore these areas should not be perceived to be safeguards for the species as it is for other felids (Oliveira 2004). It is likely that the species presents only a marginal distribution there (Oliveira unp. data). Populations in protected areas are expected to be very low, probably because of the impact of higher Ocelot (L. pardalis</em>) densities, so that conservation of Northern Tiger Cat populations should rely mostly on private lands (Oliveira et al.</em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). It has been estimated that possibly only one complex of protected areas could maintain in isolation a minimum viable population of this species (Oliveira et al.</em> 2008, Payán and Gonzalez-Maya 2011). Further studies are required on the species' ecology, demographics, natural history, and threats. This species needs to be evaluated at the subspecies level due to genetic diversity within the species. A reassessment on the taxonomy of this species is an urgent research priority as the northern portion of the population might be a distinct species (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
50654216,11511,Leopardus wiedii,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Margay populations are declining through much of its range due to human induced conversion of native forest habitats to agriculture, pasture and infrastructure development, and is predicted to continue at a rate approaching (but less than) 30% over the next 18 years (three generations), which qualifies it as Near Threatened. However, several populations are considered threatened. Although the species shows a large extent of occurrence, its area of occupancy is much smaller. In Amazonia, which is often considered a stronghold for the species, estimates suggest that Margay is not as abundant as previously perceived, but rather uncommon (Payán 2009, Oliveira et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Additionally, Margay is negatively impacted by Ocelots (through ‘the ocelot effect’), which are fairly abundant and the dominant felid species in most areas of tropical America, including protected areas (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, Margay conservation would concentrate outside protected areas and likely only in Amazonia could long-term viable populations be sustained. In most areas L. wiedii</em> is typically rare to uncommon, reaching densities around 0.01–0.05/km² (Payán 2009, Oliveira et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Bianchi et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Oliveira 2011, S. Carvajal pers. comm.). Over the next 10 years it is predicted that degradation of the Amazon by roads, hydroelectric dams, fire and deforestation will fragment and isolate remaining populations of its main stronghold. Habitat loss and fragmentation in other biomes of occurrence is also impacting the remaining populations, where the species is much rarer than in Amazonia. Protected areas outside of the Amazon are not expected to retain viable populations over the next few years (and likely do not at present) (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). This species will likely qualify for VU A3cde in the near future and should be periodically reviewed.","The Margay is strongly associated with forest habitat/tree cover, from continuous forest to small forest fragments in savanna ecosystems, both evergreen and deciduous, although it has been occasionally reported outside forested areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Oliveira 1998, 2011). It seems to be absent from the semi-arid scrub of the Caatinga domain in Brazil, with the exception of some evergreen forest enclaves (T. de Oliveira pers. comm.). This species is thought to be more arboreal and better adapted to live in trees than other cat species. It is perceived as being a little less tolerant of human settlement and altered habitat than its close relatives, the ocelot and tiger cat. Nevertheless, Margay will use highly disturbed forest, abandoned plantations and other agroforestry systems which provide sufficient tree cover (J. Schipper pers. comm., Oliveira et al.</em></em> 2010, Tortato et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Margay is a small-sized (3.3 kg) solitary felid, with an average litter size of 1.09 (1–2) (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005). Activity pattern is predominately nocturno-crepuscular, with very few records of daytime activity. Prey base consists mostly of terrestrial and scansorial small mammals, but lizards and especially birds can comprise important items at some sites. Larger medium-sized mammals, like squirrels, rabbits, agoutis, and small monkeys are also taken, but to a lesser extent. The average prey size is around 250 g. Although Margay has high arboreal abilities, it hunts mostly on the ground and most prey recorded are terrestrial (Oliveira 1998, Wang 2002, Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Bianchi et al.</em></em> 2011).&#160; Given its arboreal capabilities there has been a recurring myth that this cat is either scansorial or arboreal. It indeed possesses several unique arboreal skills, but that does not necessarily make it arboreal per se. In fact, evidence is highly suggestive of terrestrial locomotion and hunting, but nevertheless with resting time notably up in trees (Oliveira 1998, Oliveira et al.</em></em> 2010, Tortato et al.</em></em> 2013). The limited information on home range size varies from 1 to 20 km² (Oliveira et al.</em></em> 2010). Home range reported for Mexico was 4.1 km² for four males and 1 km² for a female (Carvajal-Villarreal et al.</em></em> 2012). The Margay occurs at low population densities throughout most of its range, and its numbers/densities are negatively impacted by the larger Ocelot, its potential intra-guild predator/competitor (Oliveira et al.</em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011).","The Margay has been one of the most heavily exploited Latin American cats decades ago. Margays began to appear in international trade at a time of concern over the level of exploitation of the Ocelot, and species of spotted cats in trade were rarely verified. Illegal hunting for domestic markets or for the underground skin trade has been reported to be a continuing a problem in some areas (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Current threats to this species include habitat loss, fragmentation, roads, illegal trade (pets and pelts - animals sometimes enter the pet trade), and retaliatory killing (animals are often shot due to depredation on poultry). Populations, especially outside the Amazon basin, are severely fragmented and are being reduced by habitat conversion to plantations and pasture. The species is susceptible to disease outbreaks (in Tamaulipas, Mexico there is an ongoing threat from disease). In Brazil, populations of the Atlantic forest are more threatened than those of the Amazon (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).","This species is predominantly uncommon to rare throughout its range (Payán 2009, Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Tortato et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, S. Carvajal pers. comm.). In general, Margays occur at densities of 1-5 ind./100 km², but have been estimated as high as 15-25 ind./100 km² in a very few and highly localized areas (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Where Ocelots co-occur in densities &gt;10 ind./100 km², Margay densities are expected to be much lower than 5 per 100 km² (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). The Margay is negatively impacted by Ocelot numbers and does not seem to attain effective population size for long term persistence in any Conservation Unit outside the Amazon basin possibly due to the “ocelot effect” (Oliveira et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Oliveira 2011). Thus, viable populations are expected to occur mostly outside protected areas or where Ocelot numbers are low. With the exception of the Amazon mega-reserves, it is not expected to be adequately protected anywhere else. Margays are undergoing a continuing decline due primarily to habitat loss to deforestation (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007). Considered Vulnerable in Brazil (Tortato et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) and Argentina (Diaz and Ojeda 2000), Near Threatened in Colombia (Rodriguez-Mahecha et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), Threatened in Mexico (SEMARNAT 2002), and in Costa Rica (MINAE).",,Decreasing,"The Margay ranges from the tropical lowlands of Mexico south through Central America and the Amazon basin to southern Brazil and Paraguay (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its southernmost limits reaches northeastern Argentina, north-central Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil and northern Uruguay along riverine forest (Dotta et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Tortato et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Its occurrence in the northeastern part of Brazil is restricted to the Atlantic Forest domain (Oliveira and Cassaro 2005, Tortato et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013).

There is no data confirming the new findings to be an enlargement of the Serval's distribution range or to be a shift of the range due to habitat loss and/or degradation, climate change or human impact, etc. However, habitat loss and degradation of wetlands is of concern, as is the level of skin trade in west Africa (Ray et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Servals are rare south of the Sahara in the Sahel region such as Senegal (Clement et al</em>. 2007). A 2007 Mediterranean Mammal Assessment workshop classified Servals north of the Sahara as regionally Critically Endangered. The isolated population along the Mediterranean coast, where it is known to occur only in Morocco (Cuzin 2003), possibly in Algeria (K. de Smet pers. comm.), and has been reintroduced (from East African stock) in Tunisia (Hunter and Bowland 2013), is classified regionally as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(i). There are fewer than 250 mature individuals; each subpopulation is smaller than 50 and completely isolated (from each other and from sub-Saharan African populations). The status of these populations has not been reassessed and since 2003 there are have been no new confirmed records.<br/><p><br/></p><p>  </p>","Sunquist and Sunquist (2002) stated, that the Serval has quite specific habitat requirements, so it may be locally restricted to smaller areas within its broad distribution range; it is not found in areas of rainforest or desert like habitats.<br/><br/>In sub-Saharan Africa, Servals are found in well-watered savanna long-grass environments and are particularly associated with reedbeds and other riparian vegetation types (Thiel 2011). Geertsema (1981) associated Servals with well-watered habitats like grass savannas along river reed beds and swamps, in brush and open woodlands and along the edge of forests. Van Aarde and Skinner (1986) showed significantly higher usage of riverine habitats than expected. Grimshaw et al.</em> (1995) and Andama (2000) even reported Servals on high altitude moorlands and bamboo thickets. They also range up into alpine grasslands, up to 3,800 m on Mount Kilimanjaro (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Servals can penetrate dense forest along waterways and through grassy patches, but are absent from the rainforests of Central Africa, and from desert environments. In North Africa, they are found from semi-desert to cork oak forest on the Mediterranean coast (De Smet 1989, Cuzin 2003). Servals are able to tolerate agricultural areas provided cover is available (Geertsema 1985, Thiel 2011), and may also benefit from forest clearance and the resulting encroachment of savanna at the edges of the equatorial forest belt (Ray et al.</em> 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Serval specialize in preying on small mammals, in particular rodents, with birds of secondary importance, followed by reptiles and arthropods (Geertsema 1985, Bowland 1990, Thiel 2011). In Zambia Servals feed mainly on small mammals weighing in average ca</em>&#160;70 g and up to 1.5 kg, which mostly are nocturnal and have a preference for grassland, wetland or habitats associated with water; birds have an average weight of ca</em> 250 g, in form of smaller birds (up to 200 g) or larger Galliformes (ground dwellers up to 4 kg) (Thiel 2011).","The major threat to Serval is wetland habitat loss and degradation (Thiel 2011). Wetlands harbour comparatively high rodent densities compared with other habitat types, and form the core areas of Serval home ranges. Of secondary importance is degradation of grasslands through annual burning followed by over-grazing by domestic livestock, leading to reduced abundance of small mammals (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>International legal commercial trade is generally declining (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although skins are still traded in large quantities in some countries, such as Senegal, Gambia and Benin (Burnham and Di Silvestre in Hunter and Bowland 2013), and exported to North Africa (K. de Smet and F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2007). Serval pelts seen in trade in Morocco could come from elsewhere, or could indicate the species continued existence in that country (Arce and Prunier 2006). In Zambia pelts are rarely used for traditional clothing, often it is used as substitute for Leopard skins (C. Thiel pers. comm.) Trade in West Africa appears to be primarily for ceremonial or medicinal purposes. For example, they are highly valued for traditional medicine in Nigeria, where, among markets surveyed in five south-west Nigerian towns in 1994, Servals were the second most commonly offered mammalian species (Sodeinde and Soewu 1999 in Hunter and Bowland 2013).&#160;Gadsby (1991) proved the occurrence of Serval in Nigeria based on furs of this species being commonly traded on local&#160;markets. Trade evidence is used by Maisels&#160;et al</em>. (2001) for occurrence in Cameroon and by Sayer and Green (1984) for occurrence in Benin.<br/><br/>Although Serval very rarely prey upon livestock (and indeed may even be beneficial to crop farmers due to their predilection for rodents), in rural areas throughout Africa, they are sometimes persecuted for taking poultry and indiscriminate predator control methods practised by pastoralists frequently kill them (L. Hunter and J. Bowland pers. comms.).<br/><br/>Sometimes other predators, such as leopards, hyaenas or lions, kill young and even adult Serval (Thiel 2011).","Outside northern Africa, where it is considered to meet the Red List Criteria for Endangered (Cuzin 2003) and the Sahel, where it is rare (Clement et al.</em> 2007), the Serval is commonly recorded from most major national parks and reserves. Their status outside reserves is uncertain, but they are inconspicuous and may be common in suitable habitat as they are tolerant of farming practices provided there is cover and food available (Bowland 1990, Thiel 2011). The minimum density of Servals in optimal habitat in Ngorongoro Crater was 0.42 animals/km² (Geertsema 1985) and 0.1 animals/km² in Luambe National Park in Zambia (Thiel 2011).",,Stable,"The Serval occurs widely through sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of tropical rainforest and the Saharan desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). North of the Sahara, there are few records from Morocco (Cuzin 2003), possible records in Algeria (K. de Smet pers. comm.), and after they went extinct in Tunisia, Servals have been reintroduced using animals of East African stock into Feijda National Park (Hunter and Bowland 2013). Servals are rare south of the Sahara in the Sahel region such as Senegal (Clement et al</em>.  2007).

101138963,12518,Lynx canadensis,Least Concern,,2016,2014-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<strong>This is an amended version of the original assessment that was published in 2014, with some corrections to the distribution map included. </strong><br/><br/>The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis</em>) is listed as Least Concern because over most of its range it is widespread and abundant, it has been legally harvested for the international fur trade for more than 200 hundred years, and recent decades of managed harvests do not appear to have caused any significant population decline or range loss (Mowat et al.</em> 2000). In the southern part of its range, lynx are less abundant and as a result are protected from harvest. In New Brunswick, lynx are listed as “Endangered” under the New Brunswick Species at Risk Act, in Nova Scotia as ""Endangered"" under Nova Scotia's Endangered Species Act (Nova Scotia Lynx Recovery Team 2006), and in 14 contiguous United States as ""Threatened"" under the US Endangered Species Act due to inadequate protection of habitat on Federal lands (USFWS 2000). Although a federal recovery plan for lynx in the US has not been started, since listed as Threatened, lynx in the northeast US have been increasing (Vashon et al.</em> 2012) and only one state with a resident breeding population has documented significant declines in lynx numbers (Koehler et al.</em> 2008). Lynx in the contiguous US may require connectivity with northern populations for persistence (McKelvey et al.</em> 2000, Schwartz et al.</em> 2003, Squires et al.</em> 2013). The US Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) decision to designate 39,000 acres of critical habitat in portions of Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Washington and Wyoming (USFWS 2009) has been challenged and remanded to the USFWS (Interagency Lynx Biology Team 2013).","Canada Lynx are found primarily in boreal forests, and their main prey species, the Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus</em>), depends largely on patches of successional growth (Buskirk et al.</em></em></em> 2000) in older multi-layered stands (Ruediger et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Koehler et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Squires et al.</em></em></em> 2008) or younger regenerating stands following disturbance (Burdett 2008, Vashon et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Walpole et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Hares make up 60-97% of the lynx diet, with an average consumption rate of one hare every 1-2 days (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). The lynx-hare cycle was first observed in harvest records of the Hudson’s Bay Company dating back to the early 1800s. Numbers of Snowshoe Hares peak approximately every ten years in the northern part of their range, and lynx numbers follow the same pattern with a short lag, typically 1-2 years. The fluctuations can be drastic, with hare abundance reaching 2,300/km² during the peaks, and crashing to 12/km² during the lows. While the populations of many prey and predator species are cyclic and roughly synchronous in the northern latitudes, the hare-lynx correlation is particularly close (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Three primary variables are suggested to drive the cycle: predation, herbivory, and food-plant availability (Krebs et al.</em></em></em> 2001). Historically, lynx trapping pressure also influenced the amplitude of the cycle (Gamarra and Sole 2000). Since predator and prey communities are more diverse in the southern part of the lynx range, the importance of Snowshoe Hares in the diet of southern lynx populations has been questioned (Buskirk et al.</em></em></em> 2000). However, recent studies have shown that lynx in southern areas prey almost exclusively on Snowshoe Hare (Hanson and Moen 2008, Maletzke et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Fuller et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Squires and Ruggiero 2007). Ungulates do not usually figure prominently in the lynx's diet, other than as carrion, although lynx preyed on Caribou calves in Newfoundland after the hare population crashed (Bergerud 1983). Lynx home ranges average 15-50 km² and tend to be larger on the southern periphery of their geographic distribution, suggesting that these areas contain are marginal habitat. Average lynx densities range from 1-45 animals (including young) per 100 km², and fluctuate with hare abundance (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). However, in an area in Maine where dense young stands of softwood were common, lynx home ranges were averaged 25 km² for adult females and 50 km² for adult males (Vashon et al.</em></em></em> 2008).","In most of Canada and Alaska, trapping of lynx for the fur trade is managed through regulated seasons. Trapping can reduce lynx populations and can have the greatest impact when hare populations cyclically crash. In the 1980s, in response to concerns about over-harvest during the cyclic low of the lynx-hare cycle, Alaska and most Canadian provinces modifying seasons or bag limits to match harvest with lynx population levels and trends (Golden 1999, Mowat et al.</em></em> 2000). In the early 1980s (1980-1984), an average of 35,669 Canada Lynx pelts were exported from the US and Canada during the cyclic high. By the late 1980s (1986-1989) the annual export of lynx averaged 7,360 pelts during the cyclic low. Exports have trended lower and fluctuated less severely since then, with annual exports from 2000-2006 averaging 15,387 pelts (UNEP-WCMC 2008). Historical information suggests that, despite minimal harvest controls for much of the last century, lynx-hare cycles have been largely stable in the northern part of their range and no permanent range decrease has been detected (Mowat et al.</em></em> 2000, Poole 2003).<br/><br/>In eastern Canada where lynx are protected, the primary threat is believed to be from interspecific competition from the eastern coyote, which expanded its range into eastern North America in the last few decades (Parker 2001). In southern Alberta, road density and the presence of Coyotes influenced lynx occupancy (Bayne et al.</em></em> 2008). In the contiguous US, the primary threat to lynx is habitat loss or fragmentation. Maintaining connectivity with the abundant northern lynx population is considered essential for recovery of southern lynx populations (Ruediger et al.</em></em> 2000, Nordstrom 2005,Walpole et al.</em></em> 2012, Squires et al.</em></em> 2013) especially with warmer climate (Hoving et al.</em></em> 2005, Caroll 2005). Older multi-storied forest provide winter habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare (Koehler et al.</em></em> 2008, Squires et al.</em></em> 2010) in the western US fire frequency has increased four-fold in the western U.S. in boreal forests that supports lynx and this disturbance is expected to increase with warmer climate (Westerling et al.</em></em> 2006) . However, young dense conifer forest also provides habitat for lynx and Snowshoe Hare, thus natural disturbance and logging practices that foster dense understoreys of conifers can benefit lynx and hares (Burdett 2008, Vashon et al.</em></em> 2008, and Walpole et al.</em></em> 2012). Climate change increases insect-related disturbance to boreal forests (Fleming et al.</em></em> 2002, Logan et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>Interspecific competition from other predators whose populations have increased in recent decades may also affect lynx through direct mortality or competition (Bunnell et al.</em></em> 2006, Bayne et al.</em></em> 2008, Vashon et al.</em></em> 2012, but see Kolbe et al.</em></em> 2007). The USFWS concluded that trapping was not responsible for lower lynx numbers at the edge of their range (USFWS 2000). Since listed as threatened, only a few lynx are captured and die in traps or snares set for other furbearers (DelGiudice et al.</em></em> 2007, Vashon et al.</em></em> 2012). Although lynx have been killed on logging roads with lower traffic volumes and speeds (Vashon et al.</em></em> 2012), roads with high traffic speed and volumes may result in more road mortalities (Moen et al.</em></em> 2008). Although, hybridization with bobcats has been found by genetic analysis in Minnesota, Maine, and New Brunswick (Schwartz et al.</em></em> 2003, Homyack et al.</em></em> 2008), hybridization does not appear to threaten southern lynx populations (Homyack et al.</em></em> 2008).","The Canada Lynx is primarily found in Canada and Alaska, where it is managed and trapped for its fur. It is considered Endangered in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (Cape Breton), and has been extirpated from Prince Edward Island and mainland Nova Scotia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Parker 2001, Poole 2003, Nova Scotia Lynx Recovery Team 2006). In the contiguous US, lynx populations are smaller and protected from harvest. In 2000, lynx were federally listed as threatened (USFWS 2000) in 14 States. Currently, resident breeding populations of lynx are supported in four States: Maine, Minnesota, Montana, and Washington. Lynx populations in Maine have increased in recent years (Vashon et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). The abundance of lynx in Maine likely has contributed to the recent occurrence of lynx in New Hampshire and Vermont, including evidence of reproduction (Vashon et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). The only significant recent decline in lynx numbers has occurred in Washington following recent forest fires (Koehler et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Lynx remain relatively uncommon in Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho and are absent in Oregon, New York, Wisconsin, and Michigan (USFWS 2000). Lynx were reintroduced unsuccessfully in northern New York state in the late 1980s (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), and more recently, successfully, in Colorado where some offspring born in Colorado have also reproduced (Devineau et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). In the northern parts of their range, lynx populations undergo dramatic fluctuations roughly every ten years. These population fluctuations follow the regular cycles of population increase and decline of their primary prey, the Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus</em>). This pattern of fluctuation is evident in lynx fur trade records dating back to the early 1800s (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the southern parts of their range, lynx and hares appear to maintain a relatively stable but low density (Parker 2001). Schwartz et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2003) documented reduced genetic variation in lynx from the peripheral areas of the range.",,Stable,"Canada Lynx generally occupy the boreal forest regions of North America. Its range is coincident with that of their main prey, the Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus</em>) (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Lynx occur throughout most of mainland Alaska and occupy 95% of their historic range in Canada (Parker 2001, Poole 2003). In the contiguous United States, lynx historically occurred in 24 states (McKelvey et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000), possibly ranging as far down the Rocky mountain chain to include a 25th, New Mexico (Frey 2006). However, there is some uncertainty about whether an occurrence or even many occurrences means the area is part of their historic range (McKelvey et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000). In 2000, the US Fish and Wildlife Service listed lynx as Threatened in 14 States: Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Although a recovery plan has not been written, in 2005 the US Fish and Wildlife Service identified six ""core"" areas for recovery where there had been evidence of lynx reproduction within the last 20 years: northern Maine and New Hampshire, northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern Idaho, the Kettle mountain range and “Wedge area” between the Kettle and Columbia rivers of Washington state, the northern Cascade range of Washington state, and the Greater Yellowstone area of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho (Nordstrom et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2005). A reintroduced population in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado was identified as a provisional core area where 218 lynx from Canada and Alaska were released between 1999 and 2006. Although there is evidence of reproduction, the long-term viability of this population has not been demonstrated (Devineau et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010).",See details under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Although Canada Lynx are one of five North American furbearers included on CITES Appendix II, in order to monitor the international trade of their fur, there are no quotas or suspensions currently in place. In Canada, the national and provincial governments manage harvests by region (Government of U.S. 2007), using closed seasons, quotas, limited entry and long-term trapping concessions (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In the US, trapping takes place only in Alaska, and harvest quotas are increased during periods of population increase and decreased during periods of cyclic decline (Government of U.S.&#160;2007).<br/><br/>The lynx population in the contiguous US was listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2000, due to inadequate regulatory mechanisms to protect lynx or lynx habitat on Federal lands (USFWS 2000) requiring the US government to develop a recovery plan and identify critical habitat for lynx (Nordstrom 2005). In the absence of a recovery plan, activities on federal lands are guided by the lynx conservation assessment and strategy (Interagency Lynx Biology Team 2013).<br/><br/>The US Fish and Wildlife Service has recommended various measures to trappers (e.g., avoid the use of hares or rabbits as bait) to reduce accidental taking of lynx in traps set for other furbearers (Golden and Krause 2003). In addition, several States have passed trapping regulations to further reduce accidental capture of lynx in traps set for other furbearers (Del Giudice et al.</em> 2007, Vashon et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Critical habitat designations only apply to federal lands or private lands with federally funded or permitted activities. This designation gives the federal government the authority to manage activities that affect the designated habitat. In 2009, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published a revised designation of critical habitat. The designation significantly increased a 2006 designation of 4,768 square miles within the boundaries of Voyagers National Park in Minnesota, Glacier National Park in Montana, and North Cascades National Park in Washington (USFWS 2009). In total, 39,000 square miles of critical lynx habitat was designated in 2009 as follows:<br/><br/>Maine: Approximately 9,497 square miles in portions of Aroostook, Franklin, Penobscot, Piscataquis and Somerset Counties.<br/><br/>Minnesota: Approximately 8,065 square miles in portions of Cook, Koochiching, Lake, and St. Louis Counties, and Superior National Forest.<br/><br/>Northern Rocky Mountains: Approximately 10,102 square miles in portions of Boundary County in Idaho, and Flathead, Glacier, Granite, Lake, Lewis and Clark, Lincoln, Missoula, Pondera, Powell and Teton Counties in Montana. This area includes the Flathead Indian Reservation, National Forest lands and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in the Garnet Resource Area. North Cascades: Approximately 1,836 square miles in portions of Chelan and Okanogan Counties which includes BLM lands in the Spokane District. Greater Yellowstone Area: Approximately 9,500 square miles in Gallatin, Park, Sweetgrass, Stillwater, and Carbon Counties in Montana, and Park, Teton, Fremont, Sublette, and Lincoln Counties in Wyoming. The Kettle range of Washington state was not included as critical habitat due to lack of recent evidence of reproduction, and the reintroduced population of Colorado and Utah in the southern Rockies was also not included due to lack of evidence that it is self-sustaining. In September of 2013, for the 3rd time since lynx were listed as threatened, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed revising lynx critical habitat. If revised, an additional 632 square miles will be designated as critical habitat (USFWS 2013).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

A recent assessment of the status of Eurasian Lynx (hereafter just Lynx) in Europe shows that some isolated subpopulations remain Critically Endangered or Endangered (Kaczensky et al. </em>2012).</p>","The Eurasian Lynx occurs in a wide variety of environmental and climatic conditions (Schmidt et al</em>. 2011). Throughout Europe and Siberia, it is primarily associated with forested areas which have good ungulate populations and which provide enough cover fur hunting. It inhabits extended, Temperate and Boreal forests from the Atlantic in Western Europe to the Pacific coast in the Russian Far East (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Schmidt et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>In Europe it can be found in Mediterranean forests up to the transition zone of taiga to tundra and lives from sea level up to the tree line (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008).<br/><br/>In Central Asia, Lynx occur in more open, thinly wooded areas and steppe habitats. The species probably occurs throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and has been reported both from thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas above the tree line (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003, Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Lynx occur sporadically throughout the Tibetan plateau, and are found throughout the rocky hills and mountains of the Central Asian desert regions (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Armenia Lynx are strongly associated with true forests and arid sparse forests and to a lesser extent with subalpine meadows. Lynx have been observed up to 5,500 m (Guggisberg 1975).<br/><br/>The Eurasian Lynx is the largest lynx, and the only one to primarily take ungulate prey, although they rely on smaller species where ungulates are less abundant. Lynx kill ungulates ranging in size from the 15 kg musk deer to 220 kg adult male red deer, but show a preference for the smaller ungulate species, such as Roe Deer, Chamois, Reindeer and Musk Deer. Occasionally, Lynx also hunt foxes, hares, marmots, wild pigs, beavers, birds or domestic animals such as sheep and goats, or, in Scandinavia, semi-domestic reindeer. In European Russia and western Siberia, where Roe Deer are absent, Mountain Hares and tetraonids form the basic prey base. Hares and birds are important prey also in other Central Asian regions where habitats are dryer and less forested (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008, Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003).<br/><br/>Home range size varies widely from 100 to over 1,000 km² (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Home ranges averaged 248 km² for males (n = 5) and 133 km² for females (n = 5) in a radio telemetry study in Poland’s Bialowieza forest (Schmidt et al</em>. 1997). Average home range sizes in Switzerland were 90 km² for females and 150 km² for male Lynx. Male home ranges generally enclose 1-2 female territories (Breitenmoser and Breitenmoser-Würsten 2008). Densities are typically 1-3 adults per 100 km², although higher densities of up to 5/100 km² have been reported from Eastern Europe and parts of Russia and lower densities of 0.3/100 km² from Scandinavia (Jedrzejewski et al</em>. 1996, Schmidt et al</em>. 2011, Sunde et al</em>. 2000). In the Saihanwula nature reserve in Inner Mongolia the density was estimated at 1.7-2.1/100 km² by camera trapping and track survey (Bao et al</em>. 2014). In Turkey, a density of 4.2/100 km² has been estimated for the Ciglikara Nature Reserve, Antalya. However, this high Lynx density may be temporarily and may decline with major prey (hare) fluctuation (Avgan et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p></p>","The major threats to Lynx in Europe are low acceptance due to conflicts with hunters (and in northern Europe also with livestock farmers), persecution, habitat loss and fragmentation mainly due to infrastructure development, poor management structures and accidental mortality (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012). In the Jura Mountains human related mortalities (traffic accidents, poaching) were responsible for 70 % of the known losses (Breitenmoser-Würsten et al</em>. 2007). There are also concerns in regard of the low genetic diversity and small population sizes shown in some of the populations (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer-Ruff 2003, Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012, Schmidt et al</em>. 2011, Sindicic et al</em>. 2013). The Critically Endangered Balkan Lynx is mainly threatened by poaching, loss of prey base and habitat degradation (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Asia the major threats are habitat fragmentation and loss mainly due to livestock farming, infrastructure development, resource extraction and logging activities, and poaching, mainly as retaliatory killing due to livestock depredation or for the fur trade (Kretser et al</em>. 2012, Mousavi et al</em>. 2014). In areas where livestock is the primary livelihood source, the conflict is even enhanced. Other threats include accidental mortality through trapping or dogs and human disturbance (Bao 2010). In Russia the Lynx is still important for the skin market and the pelt industry. In Azerbaijan, Mongolia and Pakistan prey base depletion due to poaching is considered a major threat (Clark et al</em>. 2006, Ud Din and Nawaz 2010). In Turkey and Nepal low population size is assumed to be problematic.<br/><br/>Poor management structures and insufficient law enforcement and the lack of capacity and funding facilitate poaching and lead to higher habitat fragmentation, aggravating the situation of the Lynx (Shkvyria 2012).","The European Lynx population (excluding Russia and Belarus) has been estimated at 9,000-10,000. In Europe, the Lynx is divided into ten distinct subpopulations which are: Alpine, Balkan, Baltic, Bohemian-Bavarian, Carpathian, Dinaric, Jura, Karelian, Scandinavian and Vosges Palatinian (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Most Lynx populations in Europe are generally stable. However, status and trend varies greatly within the European range (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012, Schmidt et al.</em> 2011). The Balkan and the Vosges-Palatinian subpopulations have decreased and the Jura and the Scandinavian ones have increased (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012). The autochthonous populations in north and east Europe (Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic and Carpathian) number each around 2,000 individuals. All the re-introduced populations are of small size (less than 200 or even less than 100 animals) and are classified as Endangered (Alpine, Dinaric and Jura subpopulation) or Critically Endangered (Bohemian-Bavarian, Vosges-Palatinian subpopulation) (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012). The European population with the greatest conservation concern is the Critically Endangered Balkan Lynx subpopulation estimated at only 40-50 individuals (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2013, Melovski 2012). In the Ukraine the Lynx is considered to be decreasing (Bashta and Dykyy 2013, Shkvyria and Shevchenko 2009).&#160; Its population in the Carpathian region has been estimated at 350-400 and the one in the Polysya region in the north of the country at 80-100 animals. Detailed status and trend information on European subpopulations can be found on <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm"">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm</a>.<br/><br/>Although a large portion of the Lynx’s range is in Asia, status and trend in many countries are poorly understood due to insufficient data. The following information has been gathered through a questionnaire sent to range country representatives (see supplementary material). In Russia the Lynx is thought to be stable in some regions and to be decreasing in others (Bersenev et al</em>. 2011). The Russian Lynx population has been estimated at around 22,510 individuals in 2013 (Monitoring and supervision centre for game animals and their habitats (CentrOkhotControl)). The numbers are based on different methods in different regions, but mainly on winter tracking plus expert corrections. More accurate censuses are performed in regions with lower lynx densities than in areas where they are abundant. Lynx has been estimated to number 1,940 in the Central region, 4,110 in North-western region, 680 in the Northern Caucasus, 40 in the Southern region, 2,400 in the Volga region, 1,070 in the Ural, 6,390 in the Siberian region&#160; and 5,890 in the Russian Far East for 2013 (Monitoring and supervision centre for game animals and their habitats (CentrOkhotControl) and with help of V.V. Rozhnov 2014). In Mongolia the Lynx population was estimated at around 10,000 (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003). The Lynx population in China has been estimated at around 27,000 by the State Forestry Administration in 2009 and is listed as Vulnerable (Wang 1998, Bao 2010). Its population and range is thought to be increasing in Inner Mongolia.<br/><br/>In Afghanistan the presence of the Lynx has been confirmed by camera trap surveys in the Wakhan District of Badakhshan and in the Northern Plateau, Yakawlang District of Bamyan provinces, since 2006. In Armenia the lynx is thought to be a common species, especially in some protected areas but the population trend is unknown. In Azerbaijan Lynx populations are thought to be stable in the Talysh Mountains, Zangezur Ridge and the foothills of the Greater Caucasus, and in arid and semi-arid landscapes around the Mingechaur Water Reservoir. In Bhutan the lynx is thought to occur in the Jigme Dorji National Park and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary, however, no concrete evidence exists (Wangchuck et al</em>. 2004). The Lynx is proposed as Vulnerable in Iran (Moqanaki et al</em>. 2010). In Iraq, except a Lynx sighting in 2006 in Darbandikhan and the first confirmed record of Eurasian Lynx in 2011 from the Barzan area, there are no recent observations (Barzani 2013). The population in Kyrgyzstan is thought to be stable but not very high and classified as Near Threatened (Sludsky 1978). The Lynx is thought to be decreasing in Nepal and classified as Vulnarable (Jnawali et al</em>. 2011), but there is no hard evidence. The only indication for its presence comes from the northwestern district of Humla, from the Dhorpatan hunting reserve and upper Mustand area in the Annapurna conservation area in 1996 (Fox 1985). Jnawali et al</em>. (2011) maps the distribution of the lynx additionally in the Rara National Park and Shey-Phoksundo National Park. The Lynx might be declining in Pakistan and its long-term survival is not assured, although it is listed as Least Concern (Sheikh and Molur 2004). In 2003 the Lynx population in northern Pakistan has been estimated at 80-120 animals and the permanently occupied area in the whole country at around 25,252 km² (Sheikh and Molur 2004). In Tajikistan the Lynx is considered as rare and is mainly found in the southern part of the country in the Darvaz range, westernmost part of the Pamir Mountains, the Ghunda valley and the Wakhan valley. In Uzbekistan, the Lynx is considered Vulnerable and thought to be decreasing but seems to be stable in the Gissar Nature Reserve, with an estimated population of 130 in 2013.",,Stable,"<p>The Eurasian Lynx has a very broad distribution. It occurs along forested mountain ranges in southeastern and Central Europe and from northern and eastern Europe through the Boreal forests of Russia, down into Central Asia and the Tibetan plateau (Kaczensky et al.</em> 2012, Nowell and Jackson 1996,&#160;Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). The Lynx's stronghold is a broad strip of southern Siberian woodland stretching from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific (Matyushkin and Vaisfeld 2003). Subpopulations in the southeast of its range (Europe and southwest Asia) are generally small and widely separated, whereas the bulk of its historic range from Scandinavia through Russia and Central Asia is largely intact.<br/> <br/> In Europe, it was probably absent from some of the larger islands such as Ireland and Sicily and from countries with few forests. It was also absent from the Iberian Peninsula, where the smaller Iberian Lynx<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;Lynx pardinus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;occurs. Lynx have been extirpated from most of Western and Central Europe with the exception of the Carpathian Mountains. It survived in a small area in the Balkans (Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro). Larger populations persisted in Fennoscandia, the Baltic States, and European Russia. Lynx have been released in several countries of Europe in an effort to bring back this elusive predator, including in Switzerland, Slovenia, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and France (IUCN 2007).</span></p>",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II and protected under the Bern Convention (Appendix III). The Lynx is protected and hunting prohibited in Afghanistan, Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Macedonia, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. In Sweden, Finland and Romania the lynx is protected but a limited number of Lynx can be killed under derogation. In Estonia and Norway the lynx is listed as a game species with an open hunting season and in Latvia Lynx can be exploited to a limited extent by sports hunting (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012). The Lynx is also subject to hunting in Iraq and Russia. In Russia, the Lynx is only hunted in places where it is abundant as in some areas of the Central region and the Volga region, in most areas of the North-Western region, the Ural, the Sibirian region and the Russian Far East. Hunting is not allowed in the Northern Caucasus and in the Southern region. The Lynx is not protected in Armenia.<br/><br/>Since 2006, a programme for the recovery of the Balkan Lynx is being implemented and range wide conservation strategies were developed (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012). In several European range states, prevention measures to counteract livestock depredation are in place and awareness has increased but measures for managing conflicts with hunters are still missing (Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>There is a need for improved monitoring activities in the Carpathian and Dinaric Lynx populations in Europe and many parts of Asia (a.o. Ud Din and Nawaz 2010, Kaczensky et al</em>. 2012). Connectivity between small isolated European lynx populations should be enhanced to allow gene flow and prevent inbreeding depression (Breitenmoser-Würsten and Obexer Ruff 2003). In Italy and Austria a reinforcement project has started to address the threat of genetic deterioration due to low population size and lacking connectivity by translocating Lynx. Detailed recommendations for the conservation of the European subpopulations are given in <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm"">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/carnivores/conservation_status.htm</a>.<br/><br/>Genetic monitoring is also needed in parts of Asia to detect the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity of the Lynx (Bao 2010).<br/><br/>In some parts of its range awareness for the species was enhanced as for example in Iraq, where stakeholders, students and social media were engaged to stop illegal hunting or as in Afghanistan, where public awareness has been raised among local communities, particularly in Badakhsahn and Bamyan Provinces, wildlife laws have been enforced in some areas and the Border Police and Customs office in certain parts of the country have been trained to control fur trade. In China the patrolling by local police was strengthened and a nature reserve network was established to expand suitable Lynx habitat. In Iran a preliminary status assessment of the lynx was conducted from 2006-2009 and a country wide status assessment in 2010-2012 (Moqanaki et al</em>. 2010, Mousavi et al</em>. in press). In Pakistan measures specific for carnivore conservation have been introduced which benefit also the Lynx. In 2010 a project focusing on lynx research and conservation education has been implemented and the protected area network has been increased. In Tajikistan measures adopted to reduce conflicts with Snow Leopards are working for Lynx as well.<br/><br/>From most range states there is only sparse information on the lynx available. Data on population trend is mainly missing. There is a need for management improvement, better monitoring and more research on Lynx ecology and distribution in Asia to increase the knowledge on the population status and trend, as well as on threats and conservation needs (Moqanaki et al</em>. 2010, Bao 2010).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
174111773,12520,Lynx pardinus,Endangered,D,2015,2014-04-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p>  </p><p></p>  <p></p><p>After six decades of decline and pronounced range contraction, between 2002 and 2012 population size of the Iberian Lynx has continuously increased to 156 mature individuals in the two remaining wild subpopulations (Simón et al. 2012). Likewise, the area of occupancy experienced a three-fold increase to reach 1,040 km². One subpopulation contains 68% of all mature individuals. Twelve mature individuals survive in two additional localities where reintroductions are currently under way (Simón et al. 2012). As a result of the increasing population size, the Iberian Lynx no longer qualifies for Critically Endangered status and is therefore listed as Endangered under criterion D. The improved status of this species is all due to intensive ongoing conservation actions.<br/><br/>Detailed demographic projections suggest that future range expansion and population increase depend upon continued reintroductions. In the absence of reintroductions, a marked decline would quickly re-occur and extinction is predicted to occur within 35 years (Fordham et al</em>. 2013). Major future threats include uncertainty about the identity and intensity of environmental drivers on lynx prey in regions where conservation efforts are currently concentrated, and uncertainty about the suitability of these regions for lynx under future climate change (Fordham et al</em>. 2013).<br/></p>  <p></p>","<p>The Iberian Lynx is a strict feeding specialist; the European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) accounts for 80-99% of its diet (Ferreras et al.</em> 2010). The Iberian Lynx is also a habitat specialist that breeds only in Mediterranean shrubland containing dense rabbit populations (Palomares et al.</em> 2000, Palomares 2001). Threshold rabbit densities for lynx reproduction are 4.5 ind./ha during the annual population peak and 1.0 ind./ha during the annual trough (Palomares et al.</em> 2001). Productive breeding territories also contain a high density of scrub-pasture ecotones which favour both ecological conditions for rabbits and a structure suitable for lynx hunting (Palomares 2001, Fernández et al. </em>2003). Other essential habitat elements include natural cavities that are used as natal dens (Fernández et al.</em> 2002, 2006). On the other hand, forestry landscapes, farmland or other open land devoid of native shrubs are rarely used by resident lynx (Palomares et al.</em> 1991) but occasionally used by subadults during natal dispersal (Palomares et al.</em> 2000).</p>","During the 20th century hunting and trapping were major sources of mortality associated with predator control and exploitation of wild rabbits (Rodríguez and Delibes 2004). Whereas the importance of this factor as a threat for Iberian Lynx has decreased (Ferreras et al</em>. 2010), during the last years some lynx have been shot or caught with illegal traps (Iberlince LIFE Project 2014). Road casualties typically produce several losses each year (Simón et al</em>. 2012, Iberlince LIFE Project 2014), as the length of paved or widened roads, as well as average traffic loads, have significantly increased in and around lynx areas (Ferreras et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Homogenization of mosaic cultural landscapes due to agricultural and silvicultural intensification during the 20th century conceivably contributed to lynx decline (Rodríguez and Delibes 2002, Ferreras et al</em>. 2010). Continued trends of abandonment of marginal livestock farming and loss of small game, sometimes followed by afforestation, further reduce the amount of potentially suitable habitat for reintroduction. Without viable land uses, maintaining suitable mosaic landscapes for the Iberian Lynx would require enduring and expensive intensive management (Rodríguez 2013). Even in landscapes with suitable structure and subject to intensive conservation management, rabbit abundance exhibits large temporal variability closely tracked by the probability of lynx breeding (Palomares et al</em>. 2001, Fernández et al</em>. 2007, Iberlince LIFE project undated).<br/><br/>Effective population size does not exceed 25 for each isolated subpopulation (Casas-Marcé et al</em>. 2013), announcing further losses of genetic diversity and accumulation of inbreeding through genetic drift. Indeed, persistent small population size over lynx generations, especially in the lowlands of the Doñana region, have produced signs of both demographic and genetic deterioration, including biased sex-ratios, decreased age of territory acquisition and litter size, and increased mortality due to disease and other natural causes (Palomares et al</em>. 2012). Lowered demographic and genetic performance could positively interact in the form of an extinction vortex (Palomares et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>As a manifestation of global change, human-assisted spread of virulent diseases affecting European Rabbits had catastrophic effects on Iberian Lynx populations in the past (Ferreras et al</em>. 2010). Although rabbits could eventually develop resistance, viral diseases remain a recurrent threat as the arrival of new strains may cause again a lasting depression of food availability for the Iberian Lynx. Moreover, the prevalent rabbit lineage in southwestern Iberia, where rabbit restocking and other conservation measures take place, might be more vulnerable to rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) than the northeastern lineage (Real et al.</em> 2009). For example, a new RHD strain has been blamed for an annual 62% decrease in productivity (average number of kittens per territorial female) in Andújar-Cardeña subpopulation (Iberlince LIFE project, undated). Likewise, diseases affecting felids also spread, sometimes with the help of uncontrolled pets that become feral or visit lynx areas from nearby towns. For example, in 2007 a feline leukaemia outbreak killed a substantial fraction of lynx in Doñana (López et al</em>. 2009, Palomares et al</em>. 2011a). Finally, detailed models combining ecological niche and metapopulation dynamics show that, without intensive intervention, climate change will rapidly decrease lynx populations and would probably lead to Iberian Lynx to extinction within 35 years (Fordham et al.</em> 2013).","The extensive survey by Guzmán et al. </em>(2004), carried out primarily during 2001, yielded an estimate of 26-31 breeding territories which could correspond to a maximum of 62 mature individuals. According to estimates produced in the framework of successive European Union LIFE Nature conservation projects, population size tripled from 52 mature individuals in 2002 to 156 in 2012 (Simón et al. </em>2012, Simón 2013).",,Increasing,"The Iberian Lynx is restricted to two separate regions of southwestern Spain, namely eastern Sierra Morena and the coastal plains west of the lower Guadalquivir. These isolated subpopulations have been named by Simón et al</em>. (2012) as Andújar-Cardeña and Doñana-Aljarafe, respectively. Two new nuclei are being founded though reintroduction 30 km southwest (Guadalmellato) and northeast (Guarrizas), respectively, of the existing Sierra Morena subpopulation, and contained a few breeding females in 2012 (Simón 2013). Five additional sites in four Spanish regions (Andalusia, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, Murcia) and Portugal are being prepared for reintroduction; the first release in Portugal happened in late 2014 (Iberlince LIFE project 2014).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation actions undertaken during the last decade have been reviewed by Ferreras et al</em>. (2010), Palomares et al</em>. (2011b) and especially Simón et al</em>. (2012).<br/><br/>The main goal of habitat management is increasing prey density. Food management includes supplementation of rabbits within enclosures and boosting wild rabbit populations. Attempts to augment rabbit numbers are carried out basically through restocking in or out predator-proof enclosures, but also acquiring rabbit hunting rights or enhancing pastures and refuge for wild rabbits. Other important resources for lynx that may be in short supply in some localities, such as cavities usable as breeding dens or artificial water spots, are provided. Management is applied to sites where suboptimal habitat quality may preclude settlement of subadults born nearby.<br/><br/>Although hunting or trapping might not be as important a mortality factor as it was in the past, lynx areas are regularly monitored for illegal traps. Measures for traffic calming and some crossing facilities have been implemented especially in road black spots. Awareness campaigns systematically performed in and around lynx areas as well as in reintroduction sites warn about the drastic effects of poaching on small populations, and informs on the conservation benefits and ecosystems services associated with Iberian Lynx preservation. Parallel education programmes target schools and the general public, which may be also engaged as volunteers.<br/><br/>Several NGOs and public administrations acquire rights on specific land uses, or help landowners to maintain their properties compatible with the conservation of the Iberian Lynx by compensating economic losses in which owners incur as a result of conservation action.<br/><br/>Some adult lynx have been translocated in order to alleviate the effects of inbreeding in the Doñana subpopulation. Additional wild individuals have been translocated some 30 km away as founders of two ongoing reintroduction attempts in Sierra Morena. A few captive-born individuals have also been used in reintroductions, after the first births of the captive-breeding programme took place in 2005 (Vargas et al</em>. 2009). To date the ex situ</em> conservation programme for the Iberian Lynx have produced over 270 individuals, and as the captive population has been built, captive-born animals are expected to be regularly used for reintroduction (Iberian Lynx Ex-situ Conservation Programme 2014). Recent models show that, to be effective, reintroductions should take into account the joint effects of climate change, prey abundance and habitat connectivity (Fordham et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The Iberian Lynx is fully protected in Spain and Portugal, listed on CITES Appendix I, and on Appendix II of the Bern Convention, and Annexes II* and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive.<br/><br/><u>Future actions</u><br/><br/>Two main avenues can be envisaged for lynx conservation, namely consolidation of existing populations and recolonization, either natural or assisted.<br/><br/>Continued intensive management, mainly in the form of habitat enhancement and increased prey density (Ferreras et al</em>. 2010, Simón et al</em>. 2012), has been suggested to resist the progressive effects of an extinction vortex whose symptoms can be noted at least in the Doñana population (Palomares et al</em>. 2012). Other components of intensive management include reduction of mortality rates from road casualties or game management (Rodríguez and Delibes 2004), and prevention of disease outbreaks transmitted by domestic animals or wildlife reservoirs (Millán et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Natural recolonization requires increasing the chances for floaters to survive and establish in large areas surrounding occupied nuclei (Rodríguez and Delibes 2003, Palomares et al</em>. 2011b, Rodríguez et al</em>. 2012). These areas may be too large for intensive species-based management to be an option, but a shift to area-based, softer management could be considered. Such management could include tax incentives for small game management, reduced transportation, industrial or urban developments, enforcement of regulations on predator control, and awareness campaigns directed to local people.<br/><br/>Regarding assisted recolonization, so far wild lynx made the bulk of founders for reintroduced populations. Continued extraction of wild lynx might not be sustainable in the long term if consolidation of existing nuclei is aimed and if extractions reduce the chances of natural colonization by surplus dispersing lynx. Individuals produced by the captive breeding programme may progressively increase their proportion in the groups of founders. This may be accompanied by an improvement of the performance (survival and eventually reproduction) of released captive-bred individuals, perhaps by raising them in semi-natural conditions. Design of the genetic composition of founders should alleviate the markedly low genetic diversity of wild populations (Casas-Marcé et al</em>. 2013). Adaptive selection of new reintroduction sites should also consider both present and forecast ecological suitability (Fordham et al</em>. 2013).<br/>  <p></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,"Global, Europe & Mediterranean"
50655874,12521,Lynx rufus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bobcat is listed as Least Concern because it is abundant and wide-ranging and is not suspected to be declining at a rate that would qualify it for Near Threatened. Bobcats are widely-distributed and their current range consists of most of the United States, southern Canada, and Mexico where the state of Oaxaca remains the southern-most limit for the species. However, local threats may present challenges for long term persistence in some regions including market hunting for the fur trade, direct habitat loss caused by increased urbanization, and indirect effects of urbanization such as genetic isolation and lethal/sublethal exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (southern California). Florida is the only US state to report Bobcat declines with Bobcat observations decreasing dramatically as invasive pythons have increased in the southern part of the state. Additionally, some concern exists about sustainability of current bag limits with the increasing value of Bobcat pelts (West Virginia). Other local threats include possible disease transmission (canine distemper in Bobcats in eastern Canada), direct conflict with domestic/feral animals including feral dogs (northern Mexico), and poisoning and medicinal uses of Bobcats (central and southern Mexico). Bobcat densities are low in central and southern, compared to northern, Mexico. The recent discovery of hybridization between the Bobcat and the sympatric Canadian Lynx may result in conservation actions for the endangered lynx recovery.","In the US, the Bobcat ranges through a wide variety of habitats, including boreal coniferous and mixed forests in the north, bottomland hardwood forest and coastal swamp in the southeast, and desert and scrubland in the southwest. Only large, intensively cultivated areas appear to be unsuitable habitat. Areas with dense understory vegetation and high prey density are most intensively selected by Bobcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The requisite features of Bobcat habitat typically include areas with abundant rabbit and rodent populations, dense cover, and shelters that function as escape cover or den sites (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Mexico, Bobcats are found in dry scrub and grassland, as well as tropical dry forest including pine, oak and fir (Monroy-Vilchis and Velazquez 2003, Arzate et al.</em></em></em> 2007, C. Lopez-Gonzalez pers. comm. 2007). <br/><br/>Like its close relative Lynx canadensis</em> the Bobcat preys primarily on lagomorphs (rabbits), but is much less of a specialist. Rodents are commonly taken, and Bobcats are capable of taking larger prey, including young ungulates (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A study in Virginia found Bobcats preyed on a wide variety of species (15 total) including squirrels, chipmunks, white-tailed deer, voles, and rabbits, appearing to switch prey seasonally as certain prey items became more available (Montague 2014, Morin et al.</em></em></em> in review).<br/><br/>Bobcats in New Hampshire appear to favour areas with few roads, limited human development, high stream densities, and steep topography (Broman et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Similarly, Bobcats in Vermont have positive responses to shrub, wetland, deciduous, and coniferous cover types, and negative responses to road and mixed cover types, and Bobcats prefer to move through forested land and scrub/rock cover rather than move through developed land cover types (Donovan et al.</em></em></em> 2011). The recently re-established Bobcats in Iowa showed a strong preference for forest over any other habitat type (Reding et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Tucker et al.</em></em></em> 2008). In Virginia, Bobcats were also shown to occur more often father away from roads (Kelly and Holub 2008). So while Bobcats can adjust to some levels of human encroachment, studies support the preference of Bobcats for vegetative cover and water in areas away from roads. Bobcat populations have been shown to decline in areas where forests have matured and no longer support abundant prey, namely cottontails (Litvaitis et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Additionally, in Texas, when in the presence of Ocelots, Bobcats selected areas with &lt;75% canopy cover, likely facilitating coexistence between the two predators and demonstrating the Bobcat’s flexibility in habitat selection (Horne et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Alternatively, another study has shown the Bobcat will expand its use of different environmental features and use of marginal habitat in the presence of Canada Lynx (Peers et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Ferguson et al.</em></em></em> (2009) gathered home range information from 29 Bobcat populations across the US and found that on average, males maintained home ranges 1.65 times the size of females. Female home ranges were 0.989–42.7 km² with a mean of 15.83 km² compared to male home ranges of 2.86– 167.9 km² with a mean of 39.70 km². Females demonstrated a strong positive association between home-range size and productivity (i.e. food availability), whereas males were influenced more by changes in size of female home ranges than by resource availability (Ferguson et al.</em></em></em> 2009, Sandell 1989).","World demand for Bobcat fur rose gradually in the late 1960s and early 1970s and jumped in the mid-1970s after CITES entered into force, when the pelts of cats listed on Appendix I became legally unobtainable for the commercial fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Of particular and concern is the recent increase in Bobcat pelt prices from $85 in 2000, to record highs of $589 in 2013,&#160; $447 in 2014, and $305 in 2015, driven by high demand for fur in China, Europe, and Russia (Knudson 2016). The number of Bobcat pelts exported from the U.S. has quadrupled in recent years, climbing to a high of 65,000 in 2013 when pelt prices were highest. <br/><br/>The US government has found that trade is not detrimental to Bobcat survival and is well-managed by state authorities. They have petitioned CITES numerous times, most recently in 2007, to remove the Bobcat from the CITES Appendices, arguing that the Bobcat does not meet the biological criteria for CITES listing and that their research indicates that importing governments should be able to reliably distinguish Bobcat skins from other species to prevent illegal trade (Govt of US 2007). However, the proposal was rejected by majority vote of the Parties to CITES (Nowell et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is viewed as another primary threat to bobcats in all three range countries. Increasing urbanization results in direct habitat loss when human density is high, although Bobcats have proven to be fairly adaptive to urbanization (Ordenana et al.</em> 2010, Tracey et al.</em> 2013 ) and low density developments (one house per two acres), particularly in areas with landscaped green spaces and golf courses, and Bobcats have been documented denning and raising litters in human structures (Riley et al.</em> 2010). However, as Bobcats adjust to human developed landscapes, indirect effects increase. Vehicle collisions can be a primary source of mortality in urban Bobcat populations (Riley et al.</em> 2006) and in populations with a high proportion of transients (Blankenship et al.</em> 2006). In addition, exposure to common rodenticides in urban landscapes can result in direct mortality (anticoagulant toxicosis) and increased susceptibility to severe notoedric mange resulting in the death of Bobcats (Riley 1999, Riley et al.</em> 2003, Riley et al.</em> 2006,&#160; Riley et al.</em> 2007, Ruell et al.</em> 2009, Serieys et al.</em> 2013). Increases in urbanization and roads have also resulted in recent genetic isolation of Bobcats populations in several areas, indicating human developments are affecting historic dispersal patterns and gene flow, resulting in local and regional population structure (Riley et al.</em> 2003, Croteau et al.</em> 2012, Ruell et al.</em> 2012, but see Millions and Swanson 2007). &#160;<br/><br/>There is concern in the northeastern US about interspecific competition with expanding coyote populations (Moruzzi et al.</em> 2002, Litvaitis and Harrison 1989, Litvaitis et al.</em> 2006). However, in Florida, where Coyotes have also increased, Thornton et al.</em> (2004) found that Bobcats and Coyotes favoured different prey species, with coyotes taking larger ungulates and Bobcats rodents and smaller mammals, and Coyotes and Bobcats coexist throughout most of the western portions of their ranges, likely through niche shifts in diet and activity (Fedriani et al.</em> 2000). Bobcats coexist with Ocelots in Texas (Horne et al.</em> 2009) and Canada Lynx in zones of sympatry (Peers et al.</em> 2013) through habitat partitioning. Aside from exploitative competition, there is evidence of interference competition through intraspecific killing by Mountain Lions (Haas 2009) and hybridization has been detected with few federally threatened Canada Lynx (Lynx canadensis</em>) in Maine, Minnesota, and New Brunswick (Homyack et al.</em> 2008). In addition, increased or novel sources of depredation in have been documented in several areas.&#160; Bobcat observations in southern Florida have decreased dramatically as invasive python densities have increased (Dorcas et al.</em> 2012). In Ventura County, California, Coyotes were found to be the leading source of Bobcat kitten mortality (Moriarty 2007), although this increase in predation pressure is likely a result of reduced avoidance options in highly fragmented urban habitat (Riley et al.</em> 2003). Interactions with domestic dogs may also present threats to the Bobcat population. Canine distemper and canine distemper-associated encephalitis has been documented in Bobcats in eastern Canada (Daoust et al.</em> 2009) validating the proposed role of dogs as a pathogen-mediated apparent competitor with Bobcats (Vanek and Gompper 2009), and several studies demonstrate negative correlation between domestic dog activity and Bobcat activity (George and Crooks 2006, Reed and Merenlender 2011). &#160;<br/><br/>In localized areas Bobcats take domestic livestock and are persecuted as pests (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In addition, there have been recent concerns about the effects of harvest on local Bobcat populations in West Virginia (WV-DNR), and Michigan (Preuss and Gehring 2007) and poaching may result in higher harvest rates than anticipated in some areas (Millions and Swanson 2006), which can result in population declines as it has in New Hampshire (Litviatus et al.</em> 2006). However, there is evidence from a survey of state game management agencies that Bobcat populations are stable or increasing, with densities greater than initially estimated, in all US states with the exception of Florida (Roberts and Crimmins 2010).","In 2010, Roberts and Crimmins surveyed state wildlife management agencies in each of the 48 contiguous states regarding the current population status of Bobcats. Populations were reported to be stable or increasing in 40 states, with six states unable to report population trends and only one state (Florida) reporting decreases in Bobcat populations. The total Bobcat population for the US is estimated to be between 2,352,276 to 3,571,681 individuals, indicating that Bobcat populations have increased throughout the majority of their range in North America since the late 1990s. In particular, Bobcat populations have rebounded in the Midwestern states in recent decades. Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Five Canadian provinces reported stable Bobcat populations, one reported a stable or increasing population, and one reported a fluctuating population. Bobcat population sizes and status in Mexico are not well known.<br/><br/>Despite being widespread, there are only a few estimates for the densities that bobcats can attain. Density estimates include: 57-62 / 100km² in California (Alonso et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), 48/100 km² in Texas (Heilbrun et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), 25/100 km² in Arizona (Lawhead 1984), &lt;9/100 km² in Idaho (Knick 1990), and 11/100 km² in Virginia (minimum estimate, M. Kelly and D. Morin pers. comm. 2015). Bobcat densities in the northern parts of their range are generally lower than in the south (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A density estimate for Bobcats in Mexico was low, at five individuals per 100 km² (Arzate et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Bobcat densities can vary dramatically depending on site and Thornton and Perkins (2015) found that densities in Texas were lowest in the most heavily modified landscape, and that Bobcat capture probability was positively related to forest cover.",,Stable,"Bobcats occur in southern Canada and throughout the United States and Mexico. In Canada, Bobcats appear to be extending their range northward as forest clearing occurs (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Recent confirmation of Bobcats via remote camera, suggests Bobcat range extends further into the Canadian Rocky Mountains than previously thought (Lobo and Millar 2010). In the United States, bobcats were thought to be extirpated by the early 1900s from several Midwestern states including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri, due to habitat loss and exploitation (Lariviére and Walton 1997), but they have recently recolonized these areas (Roberts and Crimmins 2010). Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Bobcats are found throughout Mexico, particularly in western Mexico and southward from the Sonoran desert. Competitive interactions with ecologically similar felids could be a factor in limiting their southern distribution, but similar competitors are present in other areas of Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Thus, the absence of Lynx rufus</em> below the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may be due to the absence of prey species. However, confirmative data of Bobcat presence throughout Mexico is somewhat scanty. While Bobcat range is thought to stop at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Gonzalez-Salazar et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), this is based on habitat modeling rather than verified confirmations. While generally favoring low and mid-elevations, in the western US, Bobcat have been trapped at elevations up to 2,575 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Mexico, radio-collared Bobcats were located at 3,500 m on the Colima Volcano in western Mexico (Burton et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003).","For information on use and trade , see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II. The Mexican subspecies Lynx rufus escuinapae</em> was listed on CITES Appendix I until 1992, when it was downlisted to Appendix II on the grounds that it is not a valid taxon (Govt of US 2007). Bobcats are legally harvested for the fur trade in 38 US states, and in seven Canadian provinces. In Mexico, the Bobcat is legally hunted in small numbers as a trophy animal (Govt of US 2007). There appears to be little illegal international trade (Govt of US 2007), although within the US, Millions and Swanson (2006) used molecular forensics techniques to determine that skins reported as originating from an area with a higher bag limit were probably illegally taken from an area with a lower limit.<br/><br/>Bobcat status in the mid-western United States has improved since their extirpation in the early 1900s. In Iowa, Bobcats were downgraded to threatened in 2001 and are now harvested in many counties. In Illinois, Bobcats were removed from the states’ list of&#160; threatened in 1999 and they are now found in nearly all counties. Indiana has sightings in much of the state and Bobcats were downgraded to special concern in 2005. In Ohio, the Bobcat is still classified as an endangered species and provided full protection.<br/><br/>Reintroduction of Bobcats to Cumberland Island, Georgia was highly successful (Diefebach et al.</em> 2013) suggesting Bobcats can do well when protected. In addition, Kapfer and Potts (2012) found Bobcat harvest in Minnesota could be predicted by season length and suggest population densities can be manipulated by change in length of hunting season.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Although thought to exist at relatively low population densities, the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;appears to be adaptable, and is found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance. Despite the species’ apparent habitat plasticity, the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;is forest dependent, and does not readily use oil palm Elaeis guineensis</em> plantations (Ross et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), although such plantations may not necessarily form a hard barrier to this wild cat (Nájera et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hearn et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> unpublished data). The forests of Borneo and Sumatra are undergoing some of the world’s highest deforestation rates, largely as the result of the expansion of oil palm plantations, and thus such development and consequent loss of habitat, coupled with the species’ apparent low population size, probably constitute the greatest threat to this species.<br/><br/>Population density estimates of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;on Borneo, derived from targeted camera trap surveys across a range of forest types and elevations, and a gradient of disturbance, range from 0.8 to 4.4 individuals / 100 km² (Brodie and Giordano 2012, Wilting et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data, Loken et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep), a large proportion of which (6 of 10 surveys) provide estimates of under 1.9 individuals / 100 km². Additional camera trap surveys on Borneo, specifically undertaken to detect and estimate the density of this felid, failed to find any evidence of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard, including the Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and several forest sites in Kalimantan (Cheyne et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep), indicating that Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;presence across the forested landscape of Borneo is somewhat patchy. The population density of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;on Sumatra is less well studied, but four camera surveys undertaken within the Kerinci landscape present a similar pattern to that of Borneo, with densities ranging from 0.8 to 1.6 individuals / 100 km² (Sollmann et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>A Maximum Entropy based habitat suitability analysis, using presence-only and expert opinion data in combination with environmental and land use covariates, estimated that the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard’s current area of occupancy (AOO) on Borneo is approximately 378,900 km² (Borneo Carnivore Symposium: Hearn et al.</em> in prep). Such habitat suitability data are lacking for Sumatra. For this assessment, an approximate AOO for Sumatra was developed from a map of forest cover derived from satellite images taken in 2010 (Miettinen et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Land cover classes identified as suitable habitat by expert opinion during the Bornean Carnivore Symposium in 2011 (Peat-swamp forest, Lowland Forest and lower montane forest &lt;1500 m) were selected and included in the AOO, which amounted to approximately 73,000 km², providing a total AOO of 451,900 km². As detailed below, forest cover on both Borneo and Sumatra will have decreased since 2010. Furthermore, due to a lack of sufficient data, these estimates are unable to account for the potential impacts of differential hunting pressure on population density throughout this range, which could plausibly be having a considerable impact on the species and our distribution estimate may, therefore, represent an optimistic estimation of the current AOO. Acknowledging that our estimate of current AOO may be biased high as a result of unmeasured hunting pressure and a patchy distribution, and further loss of forest post 2010, we take a precautionary approach and estimate that the mean density of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;across its AOO may be as low as 1 individual / 100 km². Extrapolation of this estimate to the wider AOO suggests that the number of mature individuals could be around 4,500 individuals, and is thus very likely to be below 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/>A GIS exercise as part of the current assessment used the habitat suitability assessment alongside land cover data for Borneo for 2000 and 2010 (Miettinen et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and the selected land cover classes for Sumatra for the years 2000 and 2010 (Miettinen et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and estimated that the AOO decreased by 33.1% during this time period, primarily as a result of forest loss and conversion to oil palm plantations. Given the strong evidence for forest dependency in this felid, this loss of AOO, coupled with hunting pressure, is probably driving a reduction in the number of mature individuals at the same rate or higher. More recent satellite imagery shows that forest loss has continued to reduce the AOO (Gaveau et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Macdonald et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep a), and it is likely that forest loss continues to this day, albeit at a reduced rate. Although the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;probably spends a proportion of its time hunting, moving and resting in the trees, because much of its time is also spent moving on the ground, Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;are prone to untargeted snaring.<br/><br/>We therefore have a strong basis upon which to infer that the total Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;population size currently lies below 10,000 individuals, and that the cumulative reduction in the AOO and thus population size as a consequence of forest loss, degradation and poaching has probably amounted to ≥30% in the past 21 years (three Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;generations, Pacifici et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013) indicating a categorisation of Vulnerable under both VU C1 and VU A2c.","The Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;appears to be a relatively adaptable species, and is found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance. Recent camera trap surveys have recorded the felid in primary lowland, upland and submontane Dipterocarp forest (Ross et al.</em></em> 2010, Brodie and Giordano 2012, McCarthy et al.</em></em> 2015, Loken et al.</em> unpubl data, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), selectively logged Dipterocarp forest (Ross et al.</em></em> 2010, Wilting et al.</em></em> 2012, Mathai et al.</em></em> 2014, Sollmann et al.</em></em> 2014, Loken et al.</em></em> unpublished data), and peat-swamp forest (Cheyne et al.</em></em> 2011, 2013). Although the species is able to persist in modified habitats, the effects of anthropogenic disturbance remain unclear. Brodie et al.</em></em> (2015) estimated the local abundance of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;through hierarchical modelling of camera-trap data with biophysical and anthropogenic covariates and found that an increased road density was associated with reduced local abundance of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards. Their study also showed that local abundance increased linearly as elevation increased, although they highlight that the effect was slight. Similar responses were shown by McCarthy et al.</em></em> (2015), who applied a Maximum entropy approach to model habitat use of the Sunda Clouded Leopard&#160;in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, and reported the species appeared to be relatively intolerant of anthropogenic features, occurring most commonly at moderate distances from roads, rivers and forest edges, all features which assist the movement of people. McCarthy et al.</em></em> (2015) also found a positive association with moderate elevation forest. Although there is much to learn about the response of the Sunda Clouded Leopard&#160;to habitat modification, the available evidence strongly supports the notion that this felid is forest dependent, and does not readily use oil palm Elaeis guineensis</em> plantations (Ross et al.</em></em> 2010, Yue et al.</em></em> in press, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), although such plantations may not necessarily form a hard barrier to this wild cat (Nájera et al.</em></em> 2013, Hearn et al.</em></em> unpublished data).<br/><br/>On Sumatra, the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;was hypothesized to exist at much lower population densities than on Borneo, potentially in response to predation and/or interspecific competition from tigers. The few density estimates that have been recorded from Sumatra (Sollmann et al.</em></em> 2014) to date, however, lie within the range of estimates for Borneo (Brodie and Giordano 2012, Wilting et al.</em></em> 2012, Cheyne et al.</em></em> 2013, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). Further data are thus needed to investigate whether interspecific competition is influencing densities of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. <br/><br/>Little is known regarding the spatial ecology of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. A female Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard, residing in a selectively logged forest in Sabah, occupied a home-range of 16.1 km² and a core-range of 5.4 km² (95% and 50% fixed kernel estimators, respectively) (Hearn et al.</em></em> 2013). The data only spanned a 109 day period, however, yet they represent the only available published data on the movements of this species. Clouded Leopards (Neofelis </em>spp.) possess morphological adaptions that enable them to climb and move swiftly in the forest canopy, and there are numerous incidental records of such behaviour in the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;on Borneo (eg. Davis 1962, Matsuda et al.</em></em> 2008, Morino 2010). Track surveys (Holden 2001, Gordon and Stewart 2007) and camera trap records (Ridout and Linkie 2009, Ross et al.</em></em> 2010, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Brodie and Giordano 2012, Wilting et al.</em></em> 2012, Cheyne et al.</em></em> 2013, Hearn et al.</em></em> 2013, Pusparini et al.</em></em> 2014, McCarthy et al.</em></em> 2015) highlight that terrestrial activity is commonplace, particularly along trails and logging roads. Rabinowitz et al.</em></em> (1987) proposed that&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;may be less arboreal on Borneo due to the absence of sympatric tigers. Movement data from tagged animals in Sabah show speeds which are indicative of a predominantly terrestrial activity pattern (Hearn et al.</em></em> unpublished data). <br/><br/>No studies as yet have quantitatively investigated the diet of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. Observations of predation events, however, suggest that the species feeds on a wide range of small to medium sized mammalian prey, including Sambar Deer Rusa unicolor</em>, Muntjacs Muntiacus </em>spp., Bearded Pig Sus barbatus</em>, Mouse Deer Tragulus </em>spp., porcupines and primates, and it is likely that the diet of this felid varies considerably across its range (Davis 1962, Rabinowitz et al.</em></em> 1987, Yeager 1991, Gordon and Stewart 2007, Matsuda et al.</em></em> 2008, Mohamed et al.</em></em> 2009, Morino 2010). Ross et al.</em></em> (2013) used camera trap data to show that Bearded Pigs exhibited greater nocturnal activity in the absence of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopardc, with female pigs and young showing the strongest response. The study suggests that Bearded Pigs, and particularly young animals, may be a key prey species and are capable of altering their activity pattern in response to this predation risk.<br/><br/>Analyses of camera trap photographs from both Borneo (Ross et al.</em></em> 2010, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Hearn et al.</em></em> 2013) and Sumatra (Ridout and Linkie 2009, Pusparini et al.</em></em> 2014, McCarthy et al.</em></em> 2015) suggest the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard’s temporal activity is largely nocturnal, with significant activity being shown during crepuscular periods, and this pattern is supported by activity data from radio-collared animals in Sabah (Hearn et al.</em></em> unpublished data). Such sources provide several instances of diurnal activity, however, and there are incidental records of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;hunting primates during the day (Davis 1962, Matsuda et al.</em></em> 2008, Morino 2010).","Habitat loss due to commercial logging and conversion to oil palm plantations and the increasing threat from poaching pose the greatest threats to the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels, and forest cover on the island of Borneo, if current deforestation rates continue, is projected to decline from 50% to less than one-third by 2020 (Rautner&#160;2005). A more recent analysis of deforestation risk predicts that by 2020 37% of the remaining forest in Borneo will have a greater than 25% risk of being deforested and that approximately 13% of Borneo’s forests (an area of 11,167 km²) will have a greater than 50% chance of being lost (Macdonald et al.</em>&#160;in prep. a). This deforestation will not only reduce the area of available habitat for the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;but it is also likely to increase the fragmentation of its populations. In a modelling analysis of the likely impacts of this deforestation, Macdonald et al.</em> (in prep. b) predict that between 2010 and 2020 the percentage of the landscape connected by dispersal in Borneo will decrease by over 60% and that this could lead to both a large reduction in the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;numbers and also a significant reduction in the potential gene flow between populations. Increased fragmentation of Clouded Leopard&#160;habitat may also be resulting in an increased risk of disease in some populations due to exposure to pathogens present in feral cat and dog populations. One study in Sabah found seropositive findings for canine parvovirus and/or distemper virus in feral cats and dogs, Malay Civets (Viverra tangalunga</em>) and Common Palm Civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</em>) living sympatrically with Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;(Nájera et al.</em> in prep).<br/><br/>Poaching, either directly through the use of snares, or through the reduction of prey availability by the poaching of game species, poses a significant threat, both in Sumatra (Holden et al.</em> 2001) and Borneo (Rabinowitz et al.</em> 1987, Wilting et al.</em> 2006, Cheyne et al.</em> 2013).","Our understanding of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard’s population density on Borneo, and particularly in the Malaysian state of Sabah, has improved in recent years, with the advent of intensive, targeted camera traps surveys, analysed within a capture-recapture framework. Population density estimates from a range of forest types and elevations, and a gradient of disturbance are typically low (0.8 – 4.4 ind. / 100 km², with 6 of 10 surveys providing estimates of under 1.9 ind. / 100 km². All estimates from Sabah were derived using a spatially explicit capture recapture framework (SECR), from primary Dipterocarp forest, including lowland (Maliau Basin Conservation Area, 1.9 ind. / 100 km²: Brodie and Giordano 2012, Danum Valley Conservation Area, 1.76 ind. / 100 km²: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), upland (Tawau Hills National Park, 1.85 ind. / 100 km²: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and submontane/montane (Crocker Range National Park, 1.4 ind. / 100 km²: Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), population density estimates from selectively logged forests are more variable (Tangkulap-Pinangah Forest Reserve, 0.84 ind. / 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Segaliud Lokan Forest Reserve, 1.0 ind. / 100 km²: Wilting et al.</em></em></em> 2012, Ulu Segama Forest Reserve, 2.55 ind. / 100 km², Tabin Wildlife Reserve, 2.26 ind. / 100 km² (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). In Kalimantan, there are only two studies that have yielded population density estimates of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard. Loken pers. comm.&#160;used SECR and provide estimates from the selectively logged Wehea Forest in East Kalimantan (1.23 to 3.01 ind. / 100 km²). Using a conventional capture recapture framework, which typically results in higher densities from that derived using SECR, Cheyne et al.</em></em></em> (2013) provide density estimates for a population of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopards&#160;residing within the Sabangau peat swamp, a disturbed peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan (0.7-4.4 ind. / 100 km²). Additional Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;focused surveys on Borneo failed to find any evidence of this species, including the relatively small (ca. 43 km²) and isolated Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah (Ross et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and several forest sites in Kalimantan (Cheyne et al.</em></em></em> in prep). Such surveys highlight the potential patchy nature of Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;presence across the forested landscape of Borneo. The population density of this felid on Sumatra has received less attention, but surveys are currently underway (I. Haidir pers comm, 2015), and four camera surveys undertaken within the Kerinci landscape present a similar pattern to that of Borneo, with densities ranging from 0.8 to 1.6 individuals / 100 km² (Sollmann et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>A Maximum Entropy based habitat suitability analysis for Borneo, discussed in detail above, provided a total AOO of 451,900 km² (Borneo: 378,900 km², Sumatra: 73,000 km²). Acknowledging that our estimate of current AOO may be biased high as a result of unmeasured hunting pressure, a potentially patchy distribution, and further loss of forest post-2010, we take a precautionary approach and estimate that the mean density of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;across its AOO may plausibly be as low as 1 individual / 100 km². Extrapolation of this estimate to the wider AOO suggests that the number of mature individuals range-wide could be around 4,500 individuals, with around 3,800 persisting in Borneo and as few as 730 individuals remaining in Sumatra.",,Decreasing,"The Sunda Clouded Leopard is found on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo (Buckley-Beason et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006; Kitchener et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, 2007; Christiansen et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008;&#160;Christiansen&#160;2009; Wilting et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007,&#160;2011). It is unknown if there are still Sunda Clouded Leopards on the small Batu Islands close to Sumatra. There are Clouded Leopard fossils from Java (Meijaard 2004), but no records of living animals from modern times. A Maximum Entropy habitat suitability model for Sunda Clouded Leopards on Borneo, derived from presence-only and expert opinion data in combination with environmental and land use covariates (Borneo Carnivore Symposium: Hearn et al.</em> in prep), was used to develop an estimate of this species’ current area of occupancy (AOO) on Borneo, and provided an estimate of approximately 378,900 km². Data regarding Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;habitat suitability are currently unavailable for Sumatra, however, and so as part of this assessment, an approximate AOO for Sumatra was developed by quantifying areas of suitable habitat from a land cover map derived from satellite images taken in 2010 (Miettinen et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012), based on land cover classes identified as suitable habitat by expert opinion during the Bornean Carnivore Symposium in 2011. The analysis provided an approximate AOO for Sumatra of 73,000 km², and thus a range-wide total AOO of 451,900 km². As detailed below, forest cover on both Borneo and Sumatra will have decreased since 2010. Furthermore, due to a lack of sufficient data, these estimates are unable to account for the potential impacts of differential hunting pressure on population density throughout this range, which could plausibly be having a considerable impact on the species and our distribution estimate may, therefore, represent an optimistic estimation of the current AOO.<br/><br/>The habitat suitability analysis for Borneo suggest that this felid has a widespread distribution over a large contiguous forested portion of Borneo, with the only exception being South Kalimantan, which was predicted as being largely composed of non-habitat. The distribution map presented as part of this assessment is largely based on this habitat suitability exercise, but small patches which were identified as non-habitat in the model output have been included here as habitat. In addition, the Tabin Wildlife Reserve, not included in the original model output, has been included here, based on recorded presence (Ross et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Bernard et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012).",See Threats section.,Terrestrial,"The Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;is currently listed under CITES Appendix I (as Neofelis nebulosa</em>), and warrants full listing under N. diardi</em>.

It occurs in most protected areas along the Sumatran mountain spine, and in most of the larger protected areas on Borneo, though maintaining or re-establishing connectivity among protected areas (e.g. via habitat corridors) remains a critical conservation priority for the species. The Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard&#160;has been the subject of increased research in recent years, but it remains one of the least studied of the world’s Pantherine felids, hampering the development of conservation actions. It is essential, therefore, to gain an understanding of this species’ distribution, abundance, and responses to anthropogenic modification, particularly in Sumatra, and also in Kalimantan, Sarawak and Brunei. Data on the distribution and abundance of this species in Sabah has improved greatly in recent years, and it remains essential to monitor the population over time. A detailed study of the Sunda&#160;Clouded Leopard’s basic ecology, including its diet and dispersal abilities is currently underway in Sabah.

Some range countries have maintained status quo Clouded Leopard abundance, however, the majority of range countries have experienced moderate declines, with serious declines noted for Myanmar, Viet Nam and China. The causes of Clouded Leopard declines are attributed primarily to (1) direct exploitation, (2) range fragmentation, and (3) reduction in habitat quality. Clouded Leopard exploitation for pelts is well documented in several countries, including the infamous Tachilek market along the Thai–Myanmar border. The frequency of Clouded Leopard parts available at market indicates increased pressure from hunting (Oswell 2010). Ongoing deforestation in countries such as Myanmar and Cambodia is also leading to increased fragmentation and reduction of optimal habitat for Clouded Leopard.<br/><br/>A reduction of at least 30% in the number of mature individuals over the last three generations (GL of 7 years [Pacifici et al.</em> 2013] x 3 = 21 years, 1993–2014) is suspected due to direct exploitation and habitat loss. The pattern of decline is not well understood given a lack of data on sub-population sizes and trend, and the rate of decline has probably varied. In a small part of the range we assume Clouded Leopard numbers to be roughly stable: Bhutan, Malaysia and Thailand, comprising roughly 12% of 2007 EOO and an assumed 12% of the 1993 population). We find it plausible that numbers in the remainder of its range declined at a mean annual rate of at least 1.63%, resulting in a minimum population reduction of 30% (a zero % decline in 12% of the population and a nearly 35% decline in the remaining 88%). As these threats are viewed as unlikely to cease and in some cases may not be reversible, an equivalent future decline is also suspected (a minimum future reduction in the number of mature individuals of 30% from 2015–2036). <br/><br/>We take a precautionary attitude toward uncertainty in this assessment. We are certain of relatively steep declines due to habitat loss and direct exploitation, however, the rate is not known and we assume a threshold rate that meets the A criterion for Vulnerable. Generation length could be lower: for example Yamada and Durrant (1989) reported that few Clouded Leopards in captivity were reproductively successful after five (F) or six (M) years of age, but we suspect these are dated observations given improvements in captive breeding. Also, generation length may be shortened in declining wild populations if mortality results in reduced longevity. If a shorter GL is used, and if we did not change our assumptions about the rate of decline, the suspected reduction would be less than 30% thus qualifying the species as Near Threatened. However, because we are even more uncertain about the total number of mature individuals than we are about the likelihood of decline, it is possible that they could number less than 10,000, and the species could also qualify as Vulnerable under C1.","The Clouded Leopard is intermediate in size between large and small cats, with wild females from Thailand weighing 11.5 (Austin and Tewes 1999) to 13.5 kg (Grassman et al.</em></em></em> 2005), and males 16 (Grassman et al.</em></em></em> 2005) to 18 kg (Austin and Tewes 1999).  Its coat is patterned with distinctive large cloud shaped markings, its canines are exceptionally elongated, as is its tail - for a large cat, the Clouded Leopard is highly arboreal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  They are strongly associated with forest habitat, particularly primary evergreen tropical rainforest, but there are also records from dry and deciduous forest, as well as secondary and logged forests. They have been recorded in the Himalayas up to 2,500 m and possibly as high as 3,000 m.  Less frequently, they have been found in grassland and scrub, dry tropical forests and mangrove swamps (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Radio-tracking studies in Thailand have showed a preference for forest over more open habitats (Austin et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Grassman et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>A study in Thailand's Phu Khieo&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary&#160;found that Clouded Leopards preyed upon a variety of arboreal and terrestrial prey, including Hog Deer, Slow Loris, Bush-tailed Porcupine, Malayan Pangolin and Indochinese Ground Squirrel (Grassman et al.</em></em></em> 2005).  Other observations include mainly primate prey, but also Muntjac and Argus Pheasant (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Clouded Leopards are primarily nocturnal, with crepuscular activity peaks (Grassman et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin et al.</em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Two radio-telemetry studies in different parks in Thailand found that adult male and female Clouded Leopards had similar home range sizes between 30-40 km² in size (95% fixed kernel estimators), with smaller intensively used core areas of 3-5 km² (Grassman et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin et al.</em></em></em> 2007).  While both studies found substantial home range overlap between males and females, as is typical of most felids, Grassman et al.</em></em></em> (2005) also found that the ranges of their two radio-collared males overlapped by a significant amount (39%).  Although both studies found similar home ranges, clouded leopards in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary travelled approximately twice the average daily distance (average 2 km) than Clouded Leopards in Khao Yai National Park (Grassman et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Austin et al.</em></em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Clouded Leopards may occur at higher densities when densities of the larger cats, Tigers and Leopards, are lower (Lynam et al.</em></em></em> 2001, Grassman et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Rao et al.</em></em></em> 2005).","Clouded Leopards prefer closed forest (Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005, Austin et al.</em></em> 2007), and their habitat in Southeast Asia is undergoing the world's fastest deforestation rate (1.2-1.3% a year since 1990: FAO 2007).<br/><br/>The Clouded Leopard is hunted for the illegal wildlife trade&#160;–&#160;large numbers of skins have been seen in market surveys, and there is also trade in bones for medicines, meat for exotic dishes and live animals for the pet trade (Hunter 2011). Wild animals are likely to be the primary source, but there is also some illegal trade from captive animals (Nowell 2007). Clouded Leopard exploitation for pelts are well documented in several countries, including the infamous Tachilek market along the Thai–Myanmar border. The frequency of Clouded Leopard parts available at market indicates increased pressure from hunting (Oswell 2010). Data from Tachilek on the Myanmar–Thailand border (19 surveys, 1991–2013) and Mong La on the Myanmar–China border (seven surveys, 2001–2014) show that the most common species in trade was the Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosa</em> (482 individuals, observed in 22/24 surveys. However, the trade of cat parts from Myanmar into Thailand has diminished and reaffirms the role of China in the trade of cats out of Myanmar (Nijman and Shepherd 2015).","The Clouded Leopard is most strongly associated with primary tropical forest which is rapidly disappearing across its range (Hunter 2011, Nowell and Jackson 1996), and Clouded Leopard skins have been observed in large numbers in illegal wildlife trade in Southeast Asia (Nowell 2007).

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova et al. </em>2019, Ross et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar et al. </em>2017, Adibi et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn et al. </em>2018, Dhendup et al.</em> 2019, Pal et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha et al.</em> 2014, Lama et al.</em> 2016, Regmi et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar et al.</em> 2017, Pal et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn et al. </em>2018, Barashkova et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross et al</em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross et al</em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross et al. </em>2012, Joolaee et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia et al</em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova et al.</em> 2019, Ross et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer et al. </em>2008, Xu et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer et al.</em> 2008, Xu et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",,Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed </em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki et al. </em>2019, Yusefi et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha et al.</em> 2014, Mahar et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay et al.</em> 2019, Ross et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu et al. </em>2010, Ross et al.</em> 2016, Barclay et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark et al</em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki et al. </em>2019, Dhendup et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).

These subpopulations approximately totalled an estimated 7,500 Lions in 2014 and comprise a substantial portion of the total species population, so that we feel confident in applying observed trends to the species as a whole as well as on a regional basis.<br/><br/>The overall classification of the Lion as Vulnerable masks a dichotomy: we observe that sample Lion subpopulations increased by 12% in four southern African countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and in India, while an observed decline of 60% in sample subpopulations outside these countries is inferred for the remainder of its African range. In other words, in the majority of its range the Lion meets the A2 criterion for Endangered with the inferred rate of decline over 50% in three generations, but this trend is numerically mitigated by a small number of subpopulations in a restricted geographical range.<br/><br/>This dichotomy is reflected in listings of the species in different Red Lists: in South Africa, the Lion will be categorized as Least Concern on the national Red List in preparation (Child et al</em>. In prep.), whereas in India it is Endangered (as subspecies P. l. persica</em> on the global IUCN Red List: Breitenmoser et al</em>. 2008) and in the region of West Africa meets the criteria for Critically Endangered (Henschel et al</em>. 2014, 2015).&#160; The range state list in Table 1 (attached Supporting Material) further illustrates the high threat levels across the species’ broad geographic range, as Lions have been recently extirpated in 12 African countries and we suspect possible recent extirpation in another four.<br/><br/>Among the causes of decline, the most important are indiscriminate killing in defence of human life and livestock, habitat loss, and prey base depletion. Prey base depletion is partly linked to habitat loss, but more importantly to poaching and bushmeat trade (Becker et al</em>. 2013). An emerging threat is trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, both within Africa and in Asia (IUCN 2006a, b; Riggio et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, although trophy hunting contributes positively to Lion conservation, improvements in management practices have been recommended (Lindsey et al</em>. 2013b, Hunter et al</em>. 2013, Edwards et al</em>. 2014), as when poorly regulated, it also contributes to population declines (Packer et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Croes et al</em>. 2011, Rosenblatt et al</em>. 2014). While attention is currently focused on Lion hunting reforms to ensure sustainability, the leading causes of population decline are more difficult to address and are likely to continue. The observed and inferred reductions are based on direct observation; appropriate indices of abundance; declines in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality; and actual and potential levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Several subpopulations have been stable, among them the only remaining subpopulation in Asia (surviving in the Gir Forest area of Gujarat, India) and several subpopulations in southern Africa. Subpopulations appear to be stable where management is properly funded; fencing is one of several effective conservation management techniques (Packer et al</em>. 2013). However, many Lion subpopulations occur in areas where management budgets are low, leading to local decline and even extinction, for example in West Africa (Henschel et al</em>. 2014).&#160; Little is known about Lion subpopulations in Angola, Central African Republic and South Sudan, but we fear drastic declines especially for the latter two.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we assess the Lion as Vulnerable based on criterion A, more specifically A2abcd. Lion range and abundance exceed the Vulnerable thresholds for criteria B, C and D, respectively, so these criteria do not contribute to the present assessment, whilst criterion E was not applied. Vulnerable A2abcd is the same listing as the previous assessment but with a different underlying method. Previous assessments were based on a suspected decline of the total estimated number of Lions, which necessarily included low quality data. In the present assessment we did not use total Lion estimates, because we had a better alternative. We now have enough good quality data for a representative sub-set of Lion subpopulations to calculate an observed decline, from which we infer a decline for the species as a whole.<br/><p>  </p>","The Lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of Lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer 2013). Although Lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but Lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills.<br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting. Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g., from 266-4,532 km² in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001).<br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic Lion is dry deciduous forest. The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock (Meena et al</em>. 2014). Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic Lion's diet, although the most common prey is the Chital Deer. Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African Lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","<p>The main threats to Lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect human life and livestock) and prey base depletion. Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer et al.</em> 2008). Furthermore, trophy hunting has a net positive impact in a some areas, but may have at times contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer et al</em>. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes et al.</em> 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Conflict</strong><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson et al</em>. (2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to Lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, Lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of Lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Frank et al</em>. 2006, Bauer et al</em>. 2010, Hazzah et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Prey depletion</strong><br/>Lion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Van Orsdol et al</em>. 1985, Hayward et al</em>. 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey et al</em>. 2013a). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>Illegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit [IUCN 2006a] and control [IUCN 2006b] trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). In West and Central Africa, Sogbohossou (2006) found many reported uses for Lion skins and bone in Benin (with fat and bones being most commonly utilized: N'Diaye 2014), and a survey carried out around Nigeria's Yankari National Park found more than 22 Lion parts considered to be of medicinal value, with most of the over 200 interviewees saying they had used Lion parts in the past, and half within the past three years (Born Free Foundation 2008). The widespread prevalence of fakes in the traditional medicinal market is indicative of a continued demand. While fakes may replace items in the market that otherwise would be illegally sourced from the wild, they could perpetuate demand and poaching when consumers aspire to the genuine wild item rather than making a conscious choice of an (often cheaper) alternative (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>There appears to be increasing interest in the use of African Lion bone in Asia. There is no history of Lion bone being used in traditional medicine there, but China has permitted the use of bones from captive Lions to make medicinal wines traditionally containing Tiger bone. South Africa has reported the export of large quantities of Lion bone sourced from captive animals to China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Legal international trade in bone reported as from captive-bred Lions could serve as a cover for illegally wild-sourced Lion (and other big cat) parts (Nowell and Pevushina 2014). There is also concern that wild Lion parts from eastern and Southern Africa could be drawn into the large illegal wildlife trade to Asia centred around elephant ivory.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy hunting</strong><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land providing financial resource for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities. However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer et al</em>. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male lion per 2,000 km² has been recommended (Packer et al</em>. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat (Lindsey et al</em>. 2013b). Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Whitman et al</em>. 2004, Loveridge et al</em>. 2007, Packer et al</em>. 2011). Hunter et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts for wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching and tolerance of Lion outside protected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Other</strong><br/>Disease has also been a threat to Lion subpopulations (Munson et al</em>. 2008, Trinkel et al</em>. 2011). In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by Lions, with up to 400 human Lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda and Packer 2007).<br/></p>","<p><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>This assessment is based on a time trend analysis of census data from relatively well-studied Lion subpopulations (Packer et al</em>. 2013, plus additional unpublished data provided by contributors). Census estimates were obtained by scientific research methods including total count, individual identifications, total or sample inventory using calling stations, radio telemetry, photo databases, spoor counts and density estimates based on direct observations corrected for patrol effort.&#160;These methods are rated as producing the most reliable type of Lion population estimates by background papers for the 2006 IUCN regional Lion workshops (Table 5 in Bauer et al.</em> 2005a, b).&#160;We did not include population estimates for sites which were based on extrapolation of Lion densities obtained by research in other areas, or informed guesstimates by researchers. The minimum number of census surveys per site over the assessment time period is two, but some sites have been more regularly monitored (Table 3 - Data Points column, in Supplementary Material).&#160;In some cases census methodology varied between years, and for some surveys accuracy may have been low, but the complete data set shows an obvious trend that is unlikely to be an artefact of methodological insufficiencies.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici et al</em>. (2013):</p><p><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR</p><p>Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs (Packer&#160;et al</em>. 1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; R<sub>span</sub> = 15.5 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 12 yrs (Packer&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici et al</em>. 2013)</p><p>Thus GL = 12*0.29 +3.5 = 6.98 yrs<br/><br/>To fill gaps between censuses conducted in non-consecutive years, we interpolated population sizes, assuming a linear change between years. For surveys conducted for only a few years between 1993 and 2014, we extrapolated to the beginning and end points based on an exponential rate of change taken from the observed growth rate for each respective subpopulation. However, all extrapolations are capped by the estimated carrying capacity for each reserve so that subpopulations that experienced dramatic population change were not assumed to have been at implausibly high totals in either 1993 or 2014. Subpopulations were first categorized according to whether or not the reserves were surrounded by a fence; unfenced subpopulations were further categorized according to geographical location with the exception of Niassa Reserve (Mozambique), treated as an outlier as discussed below.<br/><br/>In graph form (Figures 1-4 in the Supplementary Material) we summarize the repeated censuses of 46 different African Lion subpopulations using all available repeat-survey data. Figure 5 (in the Supplementary Material) addresses the 47th Lion subpopulation in our analysis, the only Asian subpopulation.<br/><br/>Outside parts of southern Africa, Lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62% between 1993 and 2014 (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).&#160; Although these totals only included about 4,600 Lions in the year 1993, several surveyed areas are restricted to the best-protected portions of much larger ecosystems (e.g., the phototourism areas of Selous and Serengeti).<br/><br/>In contrast, the total number of Lions in six unfenced reserves in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe only declined by about 11% (Figure 2, Supplementary Material). Note that the overall stability in southern Africa masks considerable heterogeneity: between 1993 and 2014 the monitored Lion subpopulation in a portion of the Okavango ecosystem is estimated to have declined by 46%, whereas the much smaller subpopulations in Gonarezhou and Kunene have increased dramatically.<br/><br/>The striking contrast between these three countries in southern Africa and the rest of the continent is probably related to the equally striking differences in human population densities (Packer et al</em>. 2013) in Namibia (2.5/km²), Botswana (3.4) and Zimbabwe (26) vs. Benin (78), Burkina Faso (57), Cameroon (40), Cote d’Ivoire (64), Ghana (102), Kenya (67), Nigeria (189), Rwanda (420), Senegal (68), Tanzania (48), Uganda (137) and Zambia (45).<br/><br/>The unfenced Niassa subpopulation is estimated to have increased by over 250% since 1993 (Figure 3, Supplementary Material); despite severe bushmeat poaching the Lions are still recovering from excessive prey depletion during civil war. In addition, on a shorter time scale, Lions have benefited from extensive ivory poaching, which has provided them with sizeable quantities of elephant meat (Colleen Begg pers. comm. 2014). Human population density in Mozambique is 74/km² with sizeable numbers of people living inside Niassa Reserve, so unless management is further strengthened, this unfenced Lion subpopulation may soon experience declining food supplies and increased human-lion conflicts. These arguments strongly suggest that the ‘boom’ in the Niassa Lion subpopulation has stopped and is unlikely to be repeated in the future. We therefore consider Niassa to be a special case and treat it as an outlier in our analyses, we believe that this offers a better understanding of trends, but we note that this does not alter the assessment (with Niassa included, the assessment would still be Vulnerable A2abcd).<br/><br/>The 16 fenced African subpopulations (10 in South Africa, and all but one in southern Africa) have grown by 29% since 1993, most having already reached their presumed carrying capacities by 2013 (Figure 4, Supplementary Material). Note that although these numbers now total over 3,226 lions, our data come from the great majority of fenced reserves in Africa and that little further growth can be expected in these subpopulations.<br/><br/>Asia is home to a single contiguous subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat (Figure 5, Supplementary Material). While the population has stabilized inside the Gir Reserve, the so-called “satellite” population in the surrounding countryside has expanded by ~400% in the past 21 years.<br/><br/>The 47 sample Lion subpopulations totalled an estimated 9,615 lions in 1993 (excluding Niassa, which is treated as an outlier as described above); that number shrank by 22% to 7,455 lions in 2014 (Table 2, Supplementary Material).&#160; However, as described above, there are significant regional differences evident in population trend, and we use these to inform our inferences about population trend for the species as a whole. Table 2 (Supplementary Material) groups the sample subpopulations by region in Africa, following the IUCN (2006a, b) regional Lion conservation strategies, but combining West and Central Africa due to a small sample size for Central Africa.&#160; In Southern Africa, the sample population grew by 8%, while in sharp contrast, sample populations declined by 59% in Eastern Africa and 66% in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>Table 3 (Supplementary Material) shows the estimated Lion population size in 1993 and 2014 for each of the 47 sample subpopulations with percentage change, and it can be seen that most countries had a declining trend for sample Lion subpopulations, with only four countries (India, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) seeing a growth trend. Table 4 (Supplementary Material) groups these countries with Botswana, which had a relatively low average rate of decline for its sample populations; two out of three sample subpopulations increased; the decline documented in the Okavango subpopulation was restricted to only part of the protected area; and overall 2012 estimates for the national population suggest that it his increased since 2003 (C. Winterbach unpubl. data). Mozambique is not included in this group as the increasing trend in its Niassa subpopulation is treated as an outlier in this analysis. The sample Lion population in five countries (Botswana, India, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe) grew by an estimated 12%, whereas the Lion population in the remaining African range countries declined by an estimated 61% (Table 4, Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>We infer population trend for the total Lion species population based on these two rates of change, as follows. In 2002, two separate country compilations of population estimates for Lions in Africa estimated the number of Lions in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to comprise between 1/4 to 1/3 of the total African Lion population, as shown in Table 5 (Supplementary Material). We suspect that this proportion was somewhat lower in 1993, given that the number of Lions is inferred to have increased in these countries while decreasing in the remainder, and use a figure of 1/4 or 25% for our species population trend calculation. If 25% of the Lion population increased by 12%, and 75% decreased by 60%, this results in an inferred trend of (0.75*-60%) + (0.25*12%) = -43% between 1993 and 2014 (Table 6, Supplementary Material).</p><br/>This qualifies the Lion as Vulnerable, but it is of great concern that the vast majority of the population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the criteria for Endangered. Since our sample subpopulations were all monitored, we suspect an even greater average rate of decline for unmonitored unfenced subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation effort.<br/><br/><strong>Abundance</strong><br/>For this assessment, we do not aim to provide a new estimate of total Lion numbers, we present no new data. A recent paper summarized and updated efforts to estimate the population size of the African Lion leading to the most recent estimate of 32,000 lions in 67 Lion areas (Riggio et al</em>. 2013). The paper presents some recent data, but where no new data were available it included unaltered numbers from earlier sources, such as Bauer and Van der Merwe (2004) and Chardonnet (2002). As a consequence, Riggio et al</em>. (2013) include numbers from 2002 and 2004 for areas where we believe the downward trend described above occurred. We therefore consider these sources to be insufficiently precautionary for our purpose and feel that an assessment on numbers is less robust than our assessment based on trends. Considering the difficulty in interpreting Lion numbers and the availability of an alternative (see above), we decided not to use total Lion numbers for the present assessment<br/><br/>However, we do attempt to correct for outdated sources in the Riggio et al</em>. (2013) estimate by application of the regional trends we found (Table 3, Supplementary Material) to the 2002 population size estimates within the respective regions (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004, Chardonnet 2002). These are two largely independent and reasonably comprehensive sets of estimated numbers that were coherent in time. Rather than presenting these numbers as in any way current, we look at how they might be expected to have changed.&#160;We calculated estimated present Lion numbers per region (Table 7, Supplementary Material) by applying the observed trend over the subsequent 12 years, except that numbers for West Africa were taken from a comprehensive recent survey (Henschel et al</em>. 2014) because of their greater precision. As a small modification from Chardonnet (2002) we moved the estimate for Selous ecosystem to Eastern Africa to be consistent with the regional divisions used here. The two 2002 estimates were compared in detail (Bauer et al</em>. 2005a,b), showing the ALWG study (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004) was more conservative and stricter on data quality. Most notably, Bauer and Van Der Merwe (2004) lacked data for Ruaha and Tarangire which may hold close to 5,000 Lions. With all these considerations, we have greater confidence in an estimate of closer to 20,000 Lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000.<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty&#160;</strong>We do not have sufficient confidence in earlier or recent species population estimates to employ them to estimate trend and for this assessment have used groupings of scientific time series site estimates as a proxy. &#160;Although these data are more numerous for Lions than for other big Panthera </em>cats, there is still considerable uncertainty inherent in both the data (Bauer et al</em>. 2015) and our treatment of it to estimate species population trend. Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2014) state that, ""All attitudes (towards uncertainty) should be explicitly documented. &#160;In situations where the spread of plausible values (after excluding extreme or unlikely values) qualifies a taxon for two or more categories of threat, the precautionary approach would recommend that the taxon be listed under the higher (more threatened) category.""&#160;<br/>As noted in Table 2 (see Supplementary Material), if the species trend is inferred directly from the total sample population trend, the result, a decline of 22%, would qualify the species as Near Threatened rather than Vulnerable. However, considering the demonstrated significant regional differences such an approach would be inappropriate.&#160;<br/>We treated Mozambique's Niassa subpopulation trend as an outlier and removed it from our trend analysis for reasons described above, but we also documented the effect of the exclusion. Some contributors proposed a second outlier: Tanzania’s Katavi subpopulation. Katavi has been consistently and repeatedly monitored, but the survey methodology was imprecise (vehicle transects: Caro 2011), this yielded a significant decline rate approaching 100% in a large population of over 1,100 estimated lions in the study site portion of the park in 1993 (Table 3). If Katavi would have been treated as an outlier and excluded from the analysis, inferred rate of decline would be 33%, and the rate of decline for Lions in East Africa would be 37%. Lions are still extant in Katavi (as shown in our map), although well below carrying capacity (Kiffner et al.</em> 2008). Rather than using an arbitrary low value, we used the value documented by surveys (zero); Lions are extant but at a density so low as not to be detected. While the methodology is imprecise, it has proved reliable for carnivore monitoring in the Serengeti (Durant et al</em>. 2011). Furthermore, the extent of decline may have been measured with lack of precision, but population decline remains uncontested. Since it is one of only two long-term monitoring programmes in Tanzania (Caro 2011) we decided that it was important to include these data and decided that there was insufficient ground to treat it as an outlier.<br/>Another uncertainty that needs to be documented is our treatment of small fenced reserves in southern Africa. Most of the population increases have occurred in these areas where intensive management practices include translocations, stocking, contraception and euthanasia. Such management is atypical, and as pointed out by Hayward et al</em>. (2015) the Red List Guidelines are ambiguous as to the inclusion or exclusion of fenced areas. Their exclusion from the analysis would raise the inferred Lion decline rate to 49%. Following through on our supposition that unmonitored Lion populations have undergone an even higher rate than our monitored sample, this could potentially have been interpreted as a suspected rate of decline over 50%, qualifying the Lion as Endangered. However, we did not exclude fenced populations from our assessment. Hayward et al</em>. (2015) state that such decisions should consider the ‘type, scale, frequency and effects of the suite of management interventions’ and could be taxon specific. We consider that management of Lions in the concerned areas aims to mimic natural processes, aims to retain adaptive potential and follows a meta-population management approach. We further consider that fences have been documented as effective tools in Lion conservation (Packer et al</em>. 2013). We find this sufficient justification for inclusion of these reserves.<br/>National estimated rates of population change are most meaningful in practice, and these are given in Table 3 in the Supplementary Material. &#160;We did not use national rates to gauge species decline, as the sample sizes are generally small and estimates of national Lion populations imprecise.",,Decreasing,"Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Lion formerly ranged from Northern Africa through Southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Today, the only remainder of this once widespread northern population is a single isolated subpopulation in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer 2013).<br/><br/>Lions are found in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The last assessment of extant Lion range is provided by Riggio et al</em>. (2013); they identified 67 Lion areas comprising 3.4 million km², which is 17% of historical range or about 25% of savanna Africa. We took those layers as a starting point, but made a few modifications to reflect the cautionary approach used by the IUCN Red List. Like with population numbers (see Population section), Riggio et al</em>. (2013) copied old layers in the absence of new information. De facto</em>, this means that large swathes of land are classified as Lion range based on the group exercises led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group; they found 86 Lion Conservation Units (LCUs) covering 4.6 million km² or 22% of historical range (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008). Henschel et al</em>. (2010, 2014) found that many of these LCUs in West and Central Africa no longer contained Lions, and the range map was adapted accordingly for this assessment. Similarly, the survey and mapping unit at Panthera conducted further range updates based on new survey results and other properly documented information from other regions. Furthermore, some of the mapped LCUs are located in areas where armed conflict may have had an impact on lion persistence (e.g. Central African Republic and South Sudan). Until proof of the contrary, and based on the lack of recent data to confirm Lion presence, we therefore classified such areas as Possibly Extinct but maintained Protected Areas inside them as Lion range (including many large hunting concessions, such as in the Central African Republic). Some of the areas currently mapped as Possibly Extinct could contain relict Lion subpopulations, and should be prioritized for field surveys aimed at establishing Lion status.<br/><br/>Areas where we consider Lion populations Possibly Extinct total 1,811,087 km², over half (52%) of the range classified as extant by Riggio et al</em>. (2013). We estimate extant Lion range, areas where we are reasonably confident that lions persist, based on recent records, at 1,654,375 km², or 8% of historical range. This range reduction reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge.",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Since 1975 Panthera leo</em> has been included in CITES Appendix II, and&#160; the Endangered Asiatic Lion subspecies P. leo persica</em> in CITES Appendix I. CITES listing of the Lion is currently undergoing a Periodic Review process to evaluate whether this accurately reflects the present situation, with a final recommendation of the Animals Committee expected at its 28th meeting in 2015. The Animals Committee also noted recent information regarding possible changes in the nomenclature of Lions and requests its nomenclature expert to&#160; review this information (CITES AC27 WG8). <br/><br/>In Africa, Lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way Lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for Lions in West and Central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and Eastern and Southern Africa (IUCN 2006b). By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of Lion status and management (Nowell et al</em>. 2006). These regional strategies have been used in many countries to develop Lion Conservation Action Plans. While all these documents show awareness of the threats and recognition of solutions, the continued decline in Lion range and numbers show that political priority and funding are not sufficient (Packer et al</em>. 2013).</em>",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Given the inherent difficulty of assessing this species, the normally low density with which it occupies the landscape and the effects that small population and habitat degradations can have on the species, our minimum assessment of population decrease could be a significant underestimate.<br/><br/>Since the previous Red List assessment in 2008, the threats to Jaguars have continued or intensified. The first expert mapping of Jaguar range took place in 2002 (Sanderson et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002), and the resulting map was used for the 2008 Red List assessment. Today, more is known about Jaguar distribution and abundance, allowing us to retrospectively classify areas as Jaguar range in 2015 that were previously identified as non-range or gaps in knowledge (Supplementary Material Figure 1). The 2015 mapping exercise also reflects updates to range recommended by Jaguar experts, with sufficient evidence (i.e., tracks, camera-trap photos, sightings of live or dead animals) to warrant inclusion/exclusion of range. The updated range indicates increasing fragmentation of Jaguar populations, particularly in eastern and southeastern Brazil, northern Venezuela and the Maya Forest (Selva Maya) of Mexico and Guatemala. Comparing 2015 Jaguar range to the extent of “known” range from the 2002 exercise, thereby controlling for the difference in knowledge extent, there is a 20.0% decline in Jaguar range over the past fourteen years (2002-2015), from 8.77 million km² to 7.02 million km² (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). With a more robust range map from which to begin the next assessment, the species will likely qualify for VU in the near future.<br/><br/>With a generation length of 6.84 years, we suspect at least a 20-25% loss in mature individuals over the past 21 years (three generations) because there are documented population declines together with habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Costa et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Payán et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013b, Wallace et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Espinosa et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, García-Anleu et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, González-Maya et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Maffei et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Mora et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Moreno et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Payán et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Chávez et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Olsoy et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, de Azevedo et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Paviolo et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Jedrzejewski et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales (de la Torre et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2017a, Olsoy et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, de la Torre et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Sollmann et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Ceballos et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Payán et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013a, Petracca et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","The Jaguar has a stocky, heavy body with short massive limbs associated with reduced cursorial behaviour and dense forest habitat, and robust canines and large head allowing a more powerful bite than other large cats (Seymour 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Mean body weight varies by up to 100% across their range, those living further from the equator tend to be larger (Iriarte et al.</em></em></em> 1990). This extreme variation in size may reflect variation in the availability of large prey in different habitats: the largest Jaguars occur in open flood plains areas, the Llanos in Venezuela and the Pantanal in Brazil, and take the largest prey, and the smallest Jaguars inhabit the dense forest areas of Central America and Amazonia and take smaller prey (Hoogesteijn and Mondolfi 1996, Oliveira 2002).<br/><strong><br/><u>Habitat</u></strong><br/>Jaguar habitat is typically characterized by dense forest cover (mainly primary and secondary forest), the presence of water bodies and a sufficient prey base (Swank and Teer 1989, Sanderson et al.</em></em></em> 2002). However, they are found in range of habitats from rainforest to seasonally flooded swamp areas, pampas grassland, thorn scrub woodland, and dry deciduous forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars mainly inhabit tropical lowland forest, followed by dry tropical forest, xeric habitats and finally arable lowland pastures (Sanderson et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Although Jaguars have been reported from elevations as high as 3000 m (Brown and Lopez Gonzalez 2001), they typically avoid montane forest, and have not been found in the high plateau of central Mexico or above 2700 m in the Andes (Ceballos et al.</em></em></em>, 2011). The species is more strongly associated with water in comparison to any of the other Panthera cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), indicated by their higher densities within tropical moist forests than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest (Maffei et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Even within drier areas they are only found around the main water courses. This characteristic quickly brings them into conflict with expansion of high intensity agriculture, having the same requirements of nearby water sources for irrigation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Home range</strong></u><br/>Jaguar home ranges vary in size across their geographic range, often according to the season and availability of resources (e.g. Crawshaw and Quigley 1991, Núñez et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Scognamillo et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). Generally males range further than females.<br/><br/>In the dry tropical deciduous forest of Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, female home range size ranged from 25 km² (dry season) to 60 km² (wet season) (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Nunez et al 2002). In the semi-deciduous and seasonally flooded forest of Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, male home range size ranged from 33 to 41 km² for males and 32 to 59 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Ceballos et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>In the tropical broadleaf moist lowland secondary forest of Belize, male home range size ranged from 28 to 40 km² (radio telemetry; Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). In the mosaic landscape (secondary broadleaf forest, savannah and agriculture) of Central Belize, male home ranges ranged from 103 to 194 km² in the dry season and 179 to 386 in the wet season, and from 86 to 99 km² for a single female in the dry and wet seasons respectively (95% MCP, GPS collars, Figueroa 2013).<br/><br/>In the llanos of Venezuela, home range size ranged from 93 to 100 km² (males, dry season) and ranged from 51 to 80 km² for females in the wet season and dry season respectively (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Scognamillo et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>There are numerous studies of home ranges from the seasonally inundated landscape of the Brazilian Pantanal: females 25 to 38 km² (radio telemetry; Schaller and Crawshaw 1980), females 5km² and males 20 km² for males in the wet season, and 70 and 79km², respectively, in the dry season (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw and Quigley 1991), female 38km² and male 67km² (95% fixed kernel, radio telemetry; Azevedo and Murray 2007), 57 to 176 km² (95% MCP, GPS collars; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006), and females 34 to 101 km² in the wet season, and 42 to 89 km² in the dry season, and males 79 to 149 km² in the wet season, and 58 to 263 km² in the dry season (90% adaptive kernel estimator, GPS collars, Cavalcanti and Gese (2009).<br/><br/>In the semi-deciduous rainforest of the Brazilian Atlantic forests, male home range size ranged from 87 to 139 km², and from 44 to 133 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Cullen et al.</em></em></em> 2005). It can be seen in the above review that the more recent studies using GPS technology show considerably larger range sizes compared to older VHF studies, this is especially indicative for recent GPS studies from areas where previously VHF studies were carried out. The differences are ranging from ~4-6 times larger. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these older ranges are considerably underrepresenting Jaguar home ranges. Densities based on these ranges are therefore equally overestimated.<br/><strong><br/><u>Diet</u></strong><br/>Jaguars are opportunistic hunters. Over 85 prey species (wild and livestock/domestic), including mammals, reptiles and birds, have been recorded in their diet across their geographic range (Seymour 1989).<br/><br/>Jaguars take a wide variety of prey species but large-sized ungulates are preferred when available (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The intake of large prey likely helps Jaguars save energy, since it is estimated that 50% of kills are larger prey on which they will feed for up to 4 days (Schaller and Crawshaw 1980, Nunez et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Scognamillo et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Nevertheless, Jaguar diet is highly variable, depending on prey availability, ease of capture, and a variety of additional factors (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Seymour 1989). In some areas cattle (Bos</em> sp.) comprise an important item in their diet (Polisar et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Palmeira et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Cavalcanti and Gese 2010). The decline of wild prey below a minimum threshold increases livestock depredation by big cats (Khorozyan et al</em>. 2015), which in turn may lead to retaliatory killings of felids by livestock owners. High frequency of smaller prey species is frequently reported in Jaguar diet, e.g. armadillo (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Novack et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Foster et al.</em></em></em> 2010b). The species has therefore gained a reputation of being able to persist in relatively disturbed areas with incomplete prey assemblages (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). However, most diet studies rely on scat analysis. Palomares et al.</em></em></em> (2012) showed that the high majority of these scats are from males. Diet studies are therefore highly biased towards male diets. As males do not contribute anything to the rearing of young, as single individuals, they are able to sustain themselves better at a varied diet of small species. Mothers with cubs will likely require the larger ungulates but this important component of the populations is extremely poorly represented in diet studies of scats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Reproduction</strong></u><br/>There are few studies on the reproductive ecology of Jaguars in the wild. Males and females may come together for breeding opportunities at any time of the year (e.g. Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). The female is in oestrus 6-17 day period, and gestation lasts 91-101 days (in captivity), after which the female gives birth to up to four cubs, usually two, which will stay with her for up to 24 months (Mondolfi and Hoogesijn 1982, Seymour 1989, Kitchener 1991, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cubs are fully dependent on their mother’s milk for the first 10-11 weeks, and continue to suckle until 5-6 months old (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cycling could resume 2-3 weeks following lactational anestrus (Soares et al.</em></em></em> 2006). However, inter-birth intervals documented in the wild are approximately two years (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Carrillo et al.</em></em></em> 2009). By 15-18 months, Jaguars travel and hunt independently within their mother’s range, although they may still come together at kill sites (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars are usually independent by the age of 24 months, however the age of dispersal or the social circumstances associated with it are poorly known (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Dispersal does not appear to be linked with the onset of sexual maturity, estimated at 24-30 months for females and 36-48 months for males (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Few data are available on dispersal distances however telemetry studies in the Brazilian Pantanal suggest that males disperse further than females (Quigley and Crawshaw 1992, Quigley and Crawshaw 2002). Dispersal through human-dominated landscapes may increase the likelihood of conflict with humans, particularly in areas where the habitat is highly fragmented (e.g. Sáenz and Carrillo 2002). The maximum age of last reproduction of a female recorded in the wild is 13 years (Brown and Lopez-Gonzalez 2001).<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici et al.</em></em></em> (2013). Values for age at first reproduction and longevity were agreed to by experts at the 2012 National Action Plan workshop for Jaguars in Brazil, and can be used for generation length calculations as:<br/><br/>GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs<br/>R<sub>span</sub> = 15 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 11.5 yrs<br/><br/>Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/>Thus, GL = 11.5*0.29 +3.5 = 6.84 yrs for Jaguars.","Jaguar populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Medellín et al.</em></em> 2002, Paviolo et al.</em></em> 2008, Foster et al.</em></em> 2010a, Bernal-Escobar et al.</em></em> 2015, Medellín et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos et al.</em></em> in press, Nijhawan et al.</em></em> in press), killing for trophies/illegal trade in body parts, pro-active or retaliatory killings associated with livestock depredation (Zimmermann et al.</em></em> 2005, Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2008, Quigley et al.</em></em> 2015), and competition for wild meat with human hunters (Jorgenson and Redford 1993, Foster et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Deforestation rates in Latin America are the highest in the world together with tropical Africa (FAO forest update, D’Annunzio et al.</em></em> 2015). Industrial agriculture, along with subsistence agriculture, is the most significant driver of deforestation in tropical and subtropical countries, accounting for 80% of deforestation from 2000-2010. The current contribution of agriculture to deforestation varies by region, with industrial agriculture being responsible for 30% of deforestation in Africa and Asia, but close to 70% in Latin America. The most significant agricultural drivers of deforestation include soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching, all highly prevalent throughout Latin America (http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture). The produce is mainly used for export as raw products for developing countries, not to feed local populations. Fragmentation and displacement frequently leads to lowering of densities of Jaguars and prey in leftover forest patches due to easier access and Jaguars feeding on the replaced livestock. Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley et al.</em></em> 2015, de la Torre et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Latin America is characterized by relatively low population densities with high population growth (http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). This means that the increased agricultural expansion will likely not be used to feed the expanding population of Latin America. Increased pressure on wildlife as a food source will increase. Even in low population countries like Belize, 75% of the yearly wildlife offtake can be attributed to humans, while Jaguars only account for 25% (Foster et al.</em></em> 2016). Increases in human population within these thinly populated countries means, increased fragmentation for agriculture, industry and urbanization necessary for sustaining the increased number of people, making the wildlife easier accessible for hunting. The greater need for food and potential increase in wealth for a proportion of the population means increased commercialization and increased prizes for wildlife game species, which are all Jaguar prey species.<br/><br/>Habitat loss is reducing and isolating Jaguar populations range wide (Medellín et al.</em></em> 2002, Altrichter et al.</em></em> 2006, Paviolo et al.</em></em> 2008, Petracca et al.</em></em> 2014, Medellín et al.</em></em> 2016, de la Torre et al.</em></em> 2017). Jaguars have lost about 49% of their historic geographic range (Medellín et al.</em></em> 2002, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín et al.</em> 2016; current assessment). The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) an important Jaguar prey (e.g. Foster et al.</em></em> 2010b), has been extirpated from 21% of its historical range during the past century and changed from NT to VU under the latest IUCN assessment (Altrichter et al.</em></em> 2012, Keuroghlian et al.</em></em> 2013). Jaguars have become extinct in El Salvador, Uruguay, and the United States (where there are still periodic individuals present as presumed dispersers from Mexico) (TSJRT 2012, Campbell 2015). There are documented population declines and habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos et al.</em></em> 2011, Costa et al.</em></em> 2005, Payán et al.</em></em> 2013b, Wallace et al.</em></em> 2013, Espinosa et al.</em></em> 2016, García-Anleu et al.</em></em> 2016, González-Maya et al.</em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn et al.</em></em> 2016, Maffei et al.</em></em> 2016, Mora et al.</em></em> 2016, Moreno et al.</em></em> 2016, Payán et al.</em></em> 2016, Olsoy et al.</em></em> 2016, Chávez et al.</em></em> 2016, de Azevedo et al.</em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti et al.</em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos et al.</em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales. For example, the connectivity of Jaguar habitat between Honduras and Guatemala is almost gone; similar losses have been documented across the Chaco, Iguazu and Atlantic Forest, and between Tamaulipas and Veracruz (Haag et al.</em></em> 2010, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos et al.</em></em> 2011, Chávez et al.</em></em> 2016). Isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos et al.</em></em> in press). Many Jaguar populations require connectivity between core sites to survive in the long term and these connectivity corridors are most of the time outside protected areas, and therefore vulnerable to human impacts (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Bernal-Escobar et al.</em></em> 2015). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín et al.</em></em> 2002, Sollmann et al.</em></em> 2008, Ceballos et al.</em></em> 2011, Payán et al.</em></em> 2013a, Petracca et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>The vulnerability of the Jaguar to persecution is demonstrated by its disappearance by the mid-1800 from Uruguay (Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016), El Salvador and by the mid-1900's from the south-western US (Johnson and Van Pelt 2016). Disappearance from these countries catches the current trends in a nutshell. These countries were the first areas to show rapid population increase with large scale land conversion. Retaliatory killing of the remaining exposed Jaguars led to their extinction. These processes are now taking place on a continental scale and therefore there are few areas within Jaguar range that can be considered safe. With limited technological expansion in the region, the main source of income will be industrial agriculture. With every (local) economic crisis, it means that the last Jaguar strongholds will be eroded further. Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.","<u><strong>Historic assessment of Jaguar viability </strong></u><br/><strong>High chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that populations in 70% of the Jaguar range (over 6 million km²) had a high probability for survival. Most of that area consists of the Amazon Basin rainforest, and adjoining areas of the Pantanal and Gran Chaco (Torres et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Other areas considered by Sanderson et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) to have a high probability for long-term Jaguar persistence included tropical moist lowland forest in Mesoamerica (the Selva Maya of Guatemala, Mexico and Belize) and a narrow strip of the Choco-Darien of Panama and Colombia to northern Honduras.<br/><br/><strong>Medium chance of survival: </strong>Sanderson et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that Jaguar populations in 18% of the Jaguar range (1.6 million km²) had a medium probability of long-term survival. These areas are generally adjacent to the areas considered to have a high-probability probability of survival and include a large portion of the northern Cerrado, most of the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos, and the northern part of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. In Central America and Mexico, they include the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama, southern Mexico, and the two eastern mountain ranges of Mexico, Sierra de Taumalipas and the Sierra Madre Oriental.<br/><br/><strong>Low chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) classified the remainder of Jaguar range (12%) as having a low probability for Jaguar survival, and of most urgent conservation concern. These areas include the Atlantic Tropical Forest and Cerrado of Brazil; parts of the Chaco in northern Argentina; the Gran Sabana of northern Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana; parts of the coastal dry forest in Venezuela; and the remaining range in Central America and Mexico.<br/><br/><strong><u>Current assessment of Jaguar populations</u></strong><br/><strong>Mexico</strong>: Jaguar densities in Mexico have been estimated from 0.75 to 6 adults per 100 km² (Ceballos et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Chávez et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016). The Jaguar population in the Selva Maya in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico was estimated in 2000 individuals (Ceballos et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Rodriguez-Soto et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). In the Greater Lacadona Ecosystem in southern Mexico, Jaguar density was estimated at 1.7-4.6/100 km², with an estimated population of 62 to 168 Jaguars within the protected areas of this region (de la Torre and Medellín 2011). Overall, Mexico’s national Jaguar census estimated at 4,000-5,000 individuals in 2011 (Ceballos et al.</em></em></em></em> in press). The northern and central areas of Mexico are however becoming increasingly isolated with Jaguars disappearing where they were previously still detected (Grigione et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Rosas-Rosas and Bender 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Central America</strong>: Estimates of Jaguar density from Mesoamerica from 27 studies conducted from 2000 to 2010 range from 0.74 to 11.2 /100 km², however most of the studies did not cover the minimum area to ensure unbiased density estimates (Maffei et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Nevertheless, across these sites density estimates were higher in tropical moist forest than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest, and higher in national parks compared to those from other multiple use areas (Maffei et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Densities in the Belizean Selva Maya rainforest were estimated at 7.5-8.8/100 km² (Silver et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). Jaguar density estimates in the protected lowland moist tropical forest of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize range from 3.5 (+/- SE = 0.7) to 11.0 (+/- 3.1)/100 km² (Harmsen et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Jaguar density was found to decline across the human-influenced landscape, a mosaic of unprotected forest, savannah, agriculture and settlements with distance from the protected forest (Foster 2008). The Talamanca Mountains of Costa Rica and Panama support a Jaguar population, but the probability of long-term persistence is medium to low (Gonzalez-Maya et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Similarly the Jaguar populations located in protected areas in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua are under a great pressure from deforestation and hunting (Petracca et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>South America</strong>: Jaguar density in the Brazilian Pantanal has been estimated as 6.6-6.7 /100 km², or 10.3-11.7/100 km² depending on the method used (telemetry versus camera traps, respectively, Soislao and Cavalcanti (2006). In the Bolivian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 2.8/100 km² (Madidi National Park Silver et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004), and in the Colombian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 4.5/100 km² and 2.5/100 km² (Amacayacu National Park and unprotected areas respectively; Payan 2008). Estimates of Jaguar density are 2/100 km² in the savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, 3.5/100 km² in the semiarid scrub of the Caatinga, and 2.2/100 km² in the Atlantic Forest (Silveira 2004), and 2.2-5 per 100 km² in the Bolivian Gran Chaco (Maffei et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). The Atlantic Forest subpopulation in Brazil has been estimated at 200+/- 80 adults (Leite et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002). Jaguar populations in the Chaco region of northern Argentina and Brazil, and the Brazilian Caatinga, are low-density and highly threatened by livestock ranching and persecution (Altrichter et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, T. de Oliveira pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><u><strong>Historic methodological biases</strong></u><br/>Unfortunately, many of these reported density estimates have inadequate sample sizes of area or capture and recaptures. Careful reviews have shown that these estimates tend to be biased positively rather than negatively (Foster and Harmsen 2012, Maffei et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Tobler and Powell 2013). This means that many of the older publications from before 2010 tended to overestimate densities at an unknown quantity. It also means that previous assessments have been overly optimistic about Jaguar status throughout their range.<br/><br/><u><strong>Subpopulation status</strong></u><br/>De la Torre et al.</em></em></em></em> (2017) identified 34 Jaguar subpopulations where there is little likelihood of demographic or genetic exchange, and assessed each against Red List criteria. Overall, 97% met the criteria for Critically Endangered (25 subpopulations) or Endangered (eight subpopulations) (see Figure 3a-e in the Supplementary Material). The large Amazonia subpopulation, estimated to hold 89% of the total species population (57,000 out of 64,000), was assessed as Least Concern.",,Decreasing,"The Jaguar is the largest cat of the Americas, and the only living representative of the genus Panthera </em>in the New World (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Historically it ranged from the southwestern US (where there are still some vagrants close to the Mexican border) through the Amazon basin to the Rio Negro in Argentina (McCain and Childs 2008, Di Bitetti et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Its extent of occurrence (EOO) (updated with the collaboration of 44 experts—see the lists of Assessors and Contributors and the Assessment Rationale section for a thorough description) is estimated at 9.02 million km², with its stronghold the rainforest of the Amazon basin, which comprises 57% of its total EOO. The Jaguar has been virtually eliminated from much of the drier northern parts of its range—Arizona and New Mexico in the United States, and extreme northern Sonora state in Mexico—( Johnson and Van Pelt 2016), as well as northern Brazil, the pampas scrub grasslands of Argentina and throughout Uruguay (de Azevedo et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016). In 2002, Jaguars were estimated to occupy only about 46% of its historic range (Sanderson et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). With our improved knowledge of Jaguar range (see the Assessment Rationale and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), this percentage is set at 51% currently.<br/><br/>Sanderson et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002) defined the most important areas for conservation of viable Jaguar populations (Jaguar Conservation Units or JCUs). These 51 areas cover 44.49 million km², or 49% of Jaguar range according to present calculations.","Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996).

Due to their wide geographic range, secretive nature and habitat tolerance, Leopards are difficult to categorize as a single species. Evidence suggests that Leopard populations have been dramatically reduced due to continued persecution with increased human populations (Thorn et al.</em> 2013, Selvan et al.</em> 2014), habitat fragmentation (UN 2014), increased illegal wildlife trade (Datta et al.</em> 2008), excessive harvesting for ceremonial use of skins (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015), prey base declines (Hatton et al.</em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari and Carpaneto 2006, Datta et al.</em> 2008, Lindsey et al.</em> 2014, Selvan et al.</em> 2014) and poorly managed trophy hunting (Balme et al.</em> 2009). Throughout North, East and West Africa, Middle East, East and South-east Asia, Leopards have suffered marked reductions and regional extirpations due to poaching for illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and prey loss. Human populations have increased by 2.57 percent annually from 1994 to 2014 (UN 2014) driving a 57% increase in the conversion of potential Leopard habitat to agricultural areas from 1975 to 2000 (Brink and Eva 2009). Deforestation in South-east Asia has increased for palm oil and rubber plantations (Sodhi et al.</em> 2010, Miettinen et al.</em> 2011). These factors were not incorporated in the previous assessment and likely have a substantial impact on suitable Leopard range.<br/><br/>Comparison of the extent of extant range presented in this assessment (8,515,935 km², see map) with that produced by Red List Assessors in 2007 (21,953,435 km²: Henschel et al.</em> 2008) yields a range reduction of 61%. However the severity of this reduction is inaccurate due to previous insufficient sampling (the 2016 map is much more detailed in resolution, see Methodology in the Supplementary Material), and the reduction has likely occurred over a longer time scale. Though our knowledge of the Leopard distribution is better today than in 2008, it is still limited at the national, regional and range-wide scales because reliable data on Leopard population trends are missing from large portions of their range. We suspect, however, that at least half of the reduction translates to real and relatively recent range loss. Also in southern Africa, the so called stronghold of the Leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that Leopard populations have remained stable (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015). In Zimbabwe, much Leopard range has disappeared due to the resettlement of private farmland and subsequent loss of prey populations (du Toit 2004). We estimate regional range loss of approximately 21% in southern Africa. We suspect that suitable Leopard range has been reduced by &gt;30% worldwide in the last three generations (22.3 years). We calculated generation length as 7.42 years (based on the formula presented in Pacifici et al.</em> 2013 and data from wild Leopard populations presented in Balme et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Leopard population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Leopard prey species, medium-size and large wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward et al.</em> 2007). Prey species are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey et al.</em> 2013). A commercialized bushmeat trade has caused an estimated 59% average decline in Leopard prey populations across 78 protected areas in West, East and southern Africa between 1970 and 2005 (Craigie et al.</em> 2010). Though ungulate populations have increased by 24% in southern Africa, potential prey numbers have declined by 52% in East Africa and 85% in West Africa (Craigie et al.</em> 2010). Bushmeat poaching in Mozambique (Hatton et al.</em> 2001, Fusari et al.</em> 2006) and Zambia (Lindsey et al.</em> 2014) has severely reduced Leopard prey (Becker et al.</em> 2013) inside and outside of protected areas. Many wildlife areas are suffering from substantial ungulate decline, including Zambian Game Management Areas and National Parks, maintain large mammal populations at 93.7% and 74.1% below estimated carrying capacity, respectively (Lindsey et al.</em> 2014). With such reductions to Leopard prey, we infer a &gt;50% loss of Leopard populations across East and West Africa. Through extensive poaching pressure also in Asia many prey species, such as Sambar Deer in Malaysia, are threatened with regional extirpation throughout tropical forest systems (Corbett 2007, Kawanishi et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South-east and East Asia, poaching for Leopard prey and targeted Leopard hunts for the wildlife trade market are taking place. A regional survey found that Leopards in India have been poached at a rate of four individuals per week for the illegal wildlife trade (Raza et al.</em> 2012b). Nowell and Pervushina (2012) found the illegal trade of Leopard parts was comparable to that of Tigers in Asian range States and derivative seizures with an average of 3.5 Leopards seizure cases per month in India since 2000. Preliminary data suggest that the illegal trade in Leopard skins for cultural regalia is rampant in southern Africa. It is suggested that 4,500-7,000 Leopards area harvested annually to fuel the demand for Leopards skins by followers of the Nazareth Babtist (Shembe) Church only (Balme unpub. data).<br/><br/>Poorly managed trophy hunting adds to pressure on local Leopard populations. Balme et al.</em> (2009) showed that trophy hunting was a key driver of Leopard population decline prior to intervention in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Similarly, Pitman et al.</em> (2015) demonstrated that Leopards are over-harvested across much of their range in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The concern about unsustainable trophy hunting has lately increased, e.g. South Africa has banned trophy hunting for 2016. This followed an alert by its CITES Scientific Authority that the number of Leopards in the country was unknown, and that trophy hunting posed a high risk to the survival of the species.<br/><br/>Taken all together, the Leopard meets the A2cd criterion for Vulnerable, based on loss of habitat and prey, and exploitation. These causes of the suspected reduction are not well understood, have not ceased, and are likely to continue, and future decline is anticipated unless conservation efforts are taken.","<strong>Habitat Types and Range</em></strong><br/>Leopards occur in the widest range of habitats among any of the Old World Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). They are found in the desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa in Namibia and Botswana. There are remnant populations in the arid regions of North Africa in Egypt, as well as the Arabian Peninsula. They persist in rugged montane regions of southwest Asia in Iran, in a varied range of landscapes in India and in the savanna grasslands of East and southern Africa. Leopards live in mountainous environments up to an altitude of 4,600 m on Mt. Kenya and 5,200 m in the Himalayas. They also thrive in the rainforests of West and Central Africa as well as Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. A remnant Leopard subpopulation also persists in the snowy regions of the Russian Far-East. Leopard subpopulations also occur in suburban and urban environments in India and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Leopards have survived outside protected areas in many parts of India since historical times (Daniel 1999) and even today high density of Leopards do occur among high human densities (Singh 2005, Athreya et al.</em></em></em> 2013), although associated levels of conflict can also be high (Athreya et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Occupancy survey found that Leopards occupied 174,066 km² of forest habitat in India (Jhalla et al.</em></em></em> 2008). Despite widespread occurrence they are killed in very large numbers in India (Raza et al.</em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards prefer to hunt in areas that provide sufficient cover despite higher prey densities elsewhere when sympatric with larger competitors (Balme et al.</em></em></em> 2006). <br/><br/><strong>Diet</em></strong><br/>Leopard diet is related to prey availability and presence of larger competitors. Generally, Leopards prefer medium-sized ungulate prey (10- 40 kgs) where available (Hayward et al.</em></em></em> 2006). They have a highly varied diet, however, feeding on insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals up to large ungulates. Though the Leopard as a species has the reputation of being a generalist, often individuals will become adept specialists for a particular prey item. These individuals will feed almost exclusively on that prey, occasionally supplementing their diet with other food items when necessary. Where competitors are present Leopards will cache their kills under thick vegetation or hoist their prey into the limbs of a tree. Hoisting behaviour is more often recorded where intraguild competitors density is higher. Male Leopards tend to hoist more often than females, particularly in the dry season when available ground cover is scarce (Stein et al.</em></em></em> in press). In the absence of larger competitors, leopards feed on larger prey (Ramakrishnan et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Hayward et al.</em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In many parts of its range, the importance of domestic animals in their diet is also evident with dogs, goats and cattle forming a large proportion of their diet (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em> 2001) sometimes even dominating the prey items in the diet (Athreya et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Shehzad et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Dogs have been reported as important prey for Leopards (Edgaonkar and Chellam 2002, Athreya et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Overall studies on diet of Leopards are very scant across its Asian range.<br/><br/><strong>Home Range Size</em></strong><br/>Leopard home range size varies with prey availability and habitat structure. Leopards have the largest ranges within arid and semi-arid environs where prey density is low. The largest recorded Leopard ranges include the Central Kalahari (mean = 2,182 km², Bothma et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The smallest recorded ranges correspond to rainforest habitats in south and southeast Asia. In Thailand, Grassman (1999) recorded home ranges as small as 8.8 km² for a female and an average 17.7 km² for two adult males. In India three collared Leopards in human dominated landscapes exhibited home range sizes between 8 to 15 km² (Odden et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","The primary threats to Leopards are anthropogenic. Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Hunter et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.<br/><br/>Where livestock and game farms have been created, Leopards may feed on these commercially valuable prey causing conflicts with farmers. These farmers may be intolerant to Leopard conflict and kill the Leopards for real or perceived threats to their lives and livelihoods (Stein et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Athreya et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Recent reports from northern Iraq suggest unsustainable levels of Leopard removal (Raza et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards are also targets for trophy hunting. If poorly managed, trophy hunting can be detrimental to the population, especially when permits are focused in one geographic area and targeted individuals are in their prime, territorial, reproductively active (Balme et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Leopard trophy hunting has been reviewed or closed in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia within the last five years.<br/><br/>In Indo-Malaya and China, Leopards require better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007) and recent reports estimate very high levels of Leopard removal at four individuals per week for 10 years (Raza et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b). Leopards are also killed for their skins in traditional ceremonies and other parts for medicinal use in eastern cultures. These trades can have a substantial impact on local Leopard populations.<br/><br/>In the face of changing land-use, prey availability and direct mortality from humans, Leopards have persisted where other large predators have not. Their ability to live within human-dominated landscapes and feed on a variety of prey have given many people the impression that Leopards require little concern, however, recent trends have shown that current threats have substantially reduced Leopard populations throughout West and Central Africa, South-west and South-east Asia and China.","Highly adaptable and widely distributed, Leopards can persist in areas where other large carnivores have been extirpated. However, Leopards are declining throughout most of their range (Jacobson       et al.       in review). There are no robust estimates of the total number of mature individuals range-wide, but several Asian subspecies were assessed as Endangered and Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List in 2008 and should retain these listings in 2016 based on the following population estimates and a declining trend:<br/><ul><li>Amur Leopard ( P. p. orientalis ) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(ii), D):&#160;&lt;60 (Jackson and Nowell 2008, Sugimoto       et al.       2014, Xiao    et al.    2014).</li><li>Arabian Leopard ( P. p. nimr ) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 45-200 (Mallon       et al.       2008).</li><li>Javan Leopard ( P. p. melas ) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 350-525, with &lt;250 mature breeding adults (Ario       et al.       2008).</li><li>Sri Lankan Leopard ( P. p. kotiya ) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 700-950 (Kittle and Watson 2015).</li><li>Persian Leopard ( P. p. saxicolor ) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 800-1,000 (Khorozyan 2008).<br/></li></ul>[<strong>Note</strong> that although the Red List Categories and Criteria for the subspecies assessments published in 2008 have not changed, the assessments no longer appear on The IUCN Red List as the information they contain may be out-of-date or may contradictory to the information presented here.]<br/><br/>This current (2015) assessment looked at available information on Leopard status on a regional basis (as discussed below). Across the majority of range, leopards have declined substantially (&gt;30%) since the previous assessment as determined by extensive population surveys, expert input and indirect measures supporting our conclusion that Leopards be listed as Vulnerable (criteria A2cd). Over the past three generations (22.3 years) regional Leopard populations in the Middle East, East and South-east Asia, West, Central and East Africa have seen substantial range declines due to habitat fragmentation and forest clearing, prey reductions from the bushmeat trade, illegal harvest for skins and human-wildlife conflict and retaliation for livestock depredation. Leopards have completely disappeared from regions of North Africa where they were recorded in the previous assessment. In India, the Caucasus and the Russian Far-East, Leopards have maintained their populations or increased due to improved survey methods, expanded range or intensive conservation efforts.<br/><br/><strong>AFRICA</strong><br/>There are few reliable data on changes in the Leopard ( P. p. pardus ) status (distribution or abundance) throughout Africa over the last three generations, although there is compelling evidence that subpopulations have likely declined considerably. Robust longitudinal data on 47 Lion ( Panthera leo ) subpopulations—a sympatric large carnivore—demonstrated a 42% decline in abundance across populations in the last three generations (22.3 yrs) (Balme       et al.       2013, Bauer       et al.       review). Lion population trends decreased in West, Central and East Africa, and increased in Southern Africa. Most of the factors driving Lion population declines (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to conflict, poorly managed trophy hunting) also affect Leopards. Indeed, pressure on Leopard populations is likely greater as a larger proportion of their range extends beyond protected areas. The increase in Lion populations in southern Africa was primarily due to the reintroduction of &gt;800 Lions to small, protected reserves in South Africa. Similar reintroductions were not undertaken for Leopards. Fencing of protected areas was proposed as another significant factor contributing to the increase in Lion numbers in southern Africa (Packer       et al.       2013). In contrast, fences are far less effective at reducing detrimental edge effects of ‘protected' Leopard populations (Balme       et al.       2010) and again, a far greater proportion of Leopard range falls outside protected areas (Swanepoel       et al.       2013).<br/><br/>One main factor for Leopard declines in Africa is related to prey declines. Leopard population density across Africa is known to track the biomass of their principle prey species, medium and large-sized wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward       et al.       2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey       et al.       2013). Time series data from 1970 to 2005 on the main Leopard prey species in 78 protected areas in West, East and Southern Africa, revealed a 59% average decline in population abundance across the three regions. While ungulate and other large mammal populations increased by 24% in southern Africa, they declined by 52% in East Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie       et al.       2010). Considering the Leopard’s dependence on wild prey species within its African range, concomitant Leopard declines in the same order of magnitude (&gt;50%) in West and East Africa can be inferred for the same time frame.<br/><br/>Another main driver of range loss and population decline of Leopards in Africa is habitat loss. Leopards have limited levels of ecological resilience to human-caused habitat fragmentation in Africa, and as a result are more restricted to conservation areas. Although male leopards can successfully traverse fragmented and suboptimal habitat (Fattebert       et al.       2013), in general Leopards in Africa require large contiguous habitats with low human impacts to reproduce successfully (Balme       et al.       2010). However, from 1994 to 2014, the human population in Africa increased by 2.57 percent annually (from 0.699 billion to 1.139 billion) (UN 2014), which in conjunction with a 57% increase in agriculture areas (from just over 200 million ha to almost 340 million ha) from 1975 to 2000 and a 21% decrease in natural vegetation in the region (Brink and Eva 2009) likely have negatively impacted the leopard populations. These increases in human population and habitat fragmentation were not accounted for in the previous assessment. As a subspecies  P. p. pardus  potentially qualifies as Vulnerable due to suspected population declines.<br/><br/>Although African Leopards can be regarded as a single genetic grouping, geographically they are subject to different pressures that require area-specific categorizations and conservation status assessments. Therefore, we subdivided the African continent into regional units for more detailed and specific status assessments:<br/><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Since the previous assessment, remnant populations in Morocco and Algeria are likely extirpated as recent surveys have failed to confirm their presence (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). The Egyptian population is considered very small with only a few observed signs in Elba National Park in southeastern Egypt, whereas there has been no recorded sign in Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). Therefore, the North African subpopulation potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered on the basis of a very small and declining number of mature individuals, and a full assessment is recommended.<br/><br/><u>Sub-Saharan Africa</u>: Numbers of sub-Saharan Leopards are declining within large portions of their range, particularly outside of protected areas. The populations within Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa appear to be decreasing from previous estimates with Leopards disappearing from areas with increased human development and areas of intensive conflict with humans (Hatton       et al.       2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari       et al.       2006, Lindsey       et al.       2014). Although urbanization is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (UN 2013), the majority of the population is rural, and about 60–70% of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods, mostly at a subsistence level. As a result, a large portion of the growing human population is expected to depend directly on expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing to survive. By 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to more than double to &gt;2 billion (UN 2013), and the area of cultivated land is project to increase by 51 million ha (approximately 21 %, Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012), which likely will contribute to the continued population decline of Leopards in Africa. In the absence of proactive management, populations of Leopards and other large carnivores generally decline in concert with increased human population growth (Woodroffe 2000, Linnell    et al.    2001). In summary, the combination of widespread habitat loss (21% in sub-Saharan Africa in 25 years) and prey loss inside African protected areas (59% decline) is likely to have caused concomitant Leopard declines of &gt;30% over the last three Leopard generations. The Leopard subpopulation of sub-Saharan Africa potentially qualifies as VU (criterion A2cd).<br/><br/>Additionally, we strongly recommend detailed status assessments for other areas of Africa to address regional needs and requirements (e.g., Henschel       et al.       2011).<br/><br/><strong>ASIA</strong><br/><u>Indian Leopard ( P. p. fusca )</u>: The known range of the Indian Leopard has increased compared to the previous assessment, but this is likely due to more intensive surveys conducted in previously unstudied wild and suburban environments. Poaching for wildlife trade is an increasing threat to Indian Leopards (Datta       et al.       2008). For example, Raza       et al.       (2012b) estimated that four Leopards per week have been poached for illegal wildlife trade over the previous 10 years. Additionally, high conflict is reported in some areas resulting in lethal control of problem individuals (Athreya       et al.       2013). Continuous decreases in wild prey are negatively impacting Leopard numbers in some regions (Datta       et al.       2008, Selvan       et al.       2014), indicating Leopard populations may decline in the future. Moreover, even in well protected areas, the recovery of Tiger numbers often results in lower Leopard numbers (Harihar       et al.       2011, Mondal       et al.       2012), as Tigers are known to kill and displace Leopards (McDougal 1988, Odden       et al.       2010). The first ever scientific national census of Leopards around Tiger habitats in India (except the northeast) in 2014 estimated 7,910 individuals, with a speculated national total of 12,000-14,000 (Bhattacharya 2015). A full assessment is recommended for  P. p. fusca , as it may potentially qualify as Vulnerable due to a suspected declining population containing fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/><u>North China Leopard (classically described as the subspecies  P. p. japonensis )</u>: A recent review of Leopard distribution shows a &gt;80% reduction in range considered extant in 2008 (Laguardia       et al.       in press). This subspecies, endemic to China, now occurs only in parts of seven provinces, and the total population is estimated at &lt;500 individuals (Laguardia       et al.       in press), with the number of mature individuals likely less than that. Subpopulations are small (&lt;50 individuals) and fragmented, and occur mainly in isolated nature reserves, indicating subpopulations may not be viable in the long-term. Reasons for their decline include retaliatory killings due to conflict, poaching for wildlife trade, low prey numbers (especially ungulates), and habitat loss and fragmentation (Laguardia       et al.       in press). These threats are expected to continue in the future, indicating that Leopard populations may continue to decline. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for  P. p. japonensis  or the subpopulation of North China, as it potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered or Endangered due to a small, steeply declining population.<br/><br/><u>Indochinese Leopard (classically described as the subspecies  P. p. delacouri )</u>: A recent review showed a dramatic reduction of over 80% in range where Leopards are considered extant in South-east Asia compared to 2008 (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). This subspecies is now likely extinct in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Singapore, and only small fragmented populations remain in Cambodia, southeastern China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand, resulting in a total estimated population of &lt;2,500 individuals for all of Southeast Asia (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). Targeted poaching for wildlife trade is probably the greatest factor that contributed to the recent range collapse of Leopards in South-east Asia. Leopard parts are used as substitutes for Tiger parts for medicinal purposes in China and South-east Asia, and Leopard skins are highly sought after as luxury items (J. F. Kamler pers. obs.). Poachers in South-east Asia can get up to $3,000 for a Leopard carcass (S. Prum and R. Maharjan pers. comms. 2014), and this price likely will continue to increase. Other important factors include depletion of prey base, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout all South-east Asian countries and southeastern China, primate and large (&gt;5 kg) ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Johnson       et al.       2006, Steinmetz       et al.       2010, Kawanishi       et al.       2014), which may hinder recovery of Leopards in the region. Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to Leopards in South-east Asia, particularly because these are closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. The deforestation rate in South-east Asia is the highest of all tropical regions, and the rate is still increasing (Sodhi       et al.       2010, Miettinen       et al.       2011). From 2000 to 2010, areas of primary or secondary forests decreased in all Southeast Asian countries, most of which was due to conversion to palm oil and rubber plantations, as the price of these commodities increased 130% and 333%, respectively, during the same period (Wilcove       et al.       2013). Because &lt;10% of South-east Asian forests are under some form of protection, and prices of luxury wood, palm oil, and rubber are expected to increase, habitat loss in the region is expected to continue (Sodhi       et al.       2010) and thus likely to have negativ
 impacts on the leopard populations. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for the Sout-heast Asian Leopard subpopulation ( P. p. delacouri ), as it potentially qualifies as Endangered due to a small declining population.<br/><br/><u>Other subspecies</u>: Leopards of the Arabian Peninsula ( P. p. nimr ), Java ( P. p. melas ), and Russian Far-East ( P. p. orientalis ) continue to require listing as Critically Endangered due to low population numbers and population fragmentation. Although the population of  P. p. orientalis  may have increased recently, especially on the Chinese side of the border (Xiao       et al.       2014), the total population remains &lt;60 individuals. With no noted population or range increase, the Sri Lankan Leopard ( P. p. kotiya ) should retain its current status as Endangered. The Leopard of southwestern Asia ( P. p. saxicolor or ciscaucasica ) has been recorded in previously undocumented areas of the Caucasus, such as Georgia and Azerbajian (Sarukhanova 2014, Voskyanyan 2014), however, due to overall low numbers and restricted range, this subspecies should remain listed as Endangered (Khorozyan 2008). See the individual Red List accounts for more details regarding these subspecies.<br/><br/><strong> Note </strong>: We acknowledge that additional data could reveal an increase or decrease in population size or range loss of Leopards, thus the status could change for segments of Leopard range as more data are collected.",,Decreasing,"Our assessment of Leopard distribution has been divided into two geographic regions: Africa and Asia. In order to describe these regions, we have further divided Leopard distribution into sub-regions to address local population trends. A detailed discussion of the methodology used to produce the 2015 range map can be found in the Supplementary Material.<br/><br/><strong>Leopards in Africa</em></strong><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in North Africa has been restricted by 97% of their former range with only remnant, isolated populations remaining (Durant et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). An adult male Leopard was killed in the Elba region of southeastern Egypt in retaliation for livestock depredation, though evidence of a breeding population is still uncertain (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2014). Continued camera-trapping efforts have failed to capture the presence of Leopard in the Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). The presence of Leopards was confirmed in the Ahaggar Mountains of Algeria from the genetic testing of one scat sample in 2005 but no presence has been confirmed since (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). Leopards are thought to be extirpated from Morocco (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/><u>West Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in West Africa has been dramatically reduced. This reduction is likely due to habitat fragmentation, but also more rigorous survey efforts that have confirmed presence and likely absence across the region (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014). Leopards have been confirmed in Niger along the southwestern border with Benin and Burkina Faso (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014) but previous reports in Air and Tenere National Reserves are unconfirmed. Leopards are generally restricted to a few protected areas from Senegal in the west to Nigeria in the east. Leopards have been reported in the south of Senegal including Parc National de Niokolo-Koba. In Sierra Leone, there are small remnant populations near Outamba Kilimi National Park and Gola National Forest as well as the eastern boundary with Guinea/ Liberia. Leopard populations in Liberia have been recorded in Lofa-Mano National Park in the west and Sapo National Park in the east. In Ghana, Leopards are found along the boundary with Côte d’Ivoire and Mole National Park in the north and west (c.</em> Burton pers. comm. 2014). In Benin, Leopard are found along the northern boundary. Leopards are nearly absent from Nigeria.<br/><br/><u>Central Africa</u>: In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Leopard range was largely reduced in areas of increased human influence and areas relatively easy to access and therefore open to illegal hunting and bushmeat trade. In Cameroon, Leopards are found in the northern and southern portions of the country. In Gabon, Leopards are found throughout the country with small absent pockets in the southeast and southwest. In the Central African Republic (CAR) Leopards are found in the southwest, central and eastern portions of the country. Leopards are found throughout South Sudan with the exception of the Sudd wetland.<br/><br/><u>East Africa</u>: The distribution of Leopards in East Africa has been reduced, in particular in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and central Tanzania. There are possible remnant populations in Djibouti, Eritrea, and North Sudan. They are nearly absent from Somalia. Leopards are found throughout southern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda and the west, central and southern portions of Kenya (Z. Davidson pers. comm. 2014, I. Seme pers. comm.2014, G. Yirga pers. comm. 2014). In Tanzania, Leopards are found throughout the Serengeti-Ngorogoro Crater system and to the south and west. It is thought that Leopards are absent from the southeastern boundary of Lake Victoria to Central Tanzania.<br/><br/><u>Southern Africa</u>: Southern Africa likely has the healthiest Leopard populations of their entire range. It is generally thought that Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique have declining but healthy Leopard populations outside of human dominated areas (C.&#160;</em>Begg pers. comm. 2014, A. Loveridge pers. comm. 2014, P. Schuette pers. comm. 2014). In Namibia, Leopards inhabit most of the country with the exception of the highly populated northern region, the arid southeast farmlands and the desert coast (Stein 2011). Botswana has a continuous Leopard population in the North and West. In South Africa, Leopards are found along the boundaries with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique with dense populations located in the Limpopo region. Leopards are also located in the Cape provinces of South Africa.<br/><br/><strong>Leopards in Asia</em></strong><br/><u>Middle East</u>: The main stronghold for the Arabian Leopard (<span>P. p. nimr</em>) is the continuous tract of the Dhofar area in southwestern Oman and the Hawf area in northeastern Yemen (Khorozyan et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Spalton et al </em>2014). There are also small, isolated populations in Saudi Arabia (Zaffar-ul-Islam et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). In 2006, Leopard populations were estimated at eight individuals in Israel's Judean Desert and Negev Highlands respectively, however, they have not been confirmed since (Perez et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). The species is likely extirpated in the Musandam Peninsula of Oman and UAE (J. Spalton pers. comm. 2014, Spalton et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards are probably extinct in Jordan (Qarqaz and Abu Baker 2006), UAE (Edmonds et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Spalton et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006) and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (Spalton et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006), with the possibility of rare forays from the Negev (Mallon et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Asia and the Caucasus</strong></em><br/>Recent surveys found that Leopards have a wide distribution in Iran, mostly in the region of the two mountain chains consisting of Alborz running northwest to northeast and Zagros from northwest to the south (Sanei and Zakaria 2011). Their presence is also recorded in Golestan National Park, Iran which is located in the northeastern part of Iran near the border with Turkmenistan (Erfanian et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hamidi et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). A few recently confirmed records from Iraq and Turkey are restricted to the mountainous areas of Kurdistan (B. Avgan and H. Raza pers. comms. 2014), where Leopard is known to be scarce. There are numerous camera-trap records dated 2013-2014 confirming the presence of a small population in the Zangezur Ridge shared by Armenia and Azerbaijan (B. Avgan and A. Malkhasyan pers. comms. 2014, Voskanyan 2014, Sarukhanova 2014). Two individuals are recorded in Talysh Mountains of southeastern Azerbaijan (Sarukhanova 2014). There is recent camera trapping evidence from Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan (Avgan et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Recently, a Leopard was video-trapped in North Ossetia, Georgia (P. Weinberg pers. comm. 2014). There are no confirmed recent records in Dagestan although Leopards definitely lived here in low numbers in the 1980s and the last confirmed photograph was taken in 2009 (Yarovenko 2010, Y. Yarovenko pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><u>South and Central Asia</u>: There is some indication of its presence in the Babatag and Kugitang mountains of Uzbekistan (N. Marmazinskaya pers. comm. 2014). A confirmed record of Leopard was obtained in Afghanistan in the Bamyan province in 2011 in a camera trap image (Moheb and Bradfield 2014). In Pakistan, Leopards also inhabits broken hilly or mountainous country throughout Waziristan, Baluchistan and Sindh Kohistan in association with acacia scrub forest (Roberts 1997). A recent study using DNA from scats found Leopard presence in northeast Pakistan from the Ayubia National Park (Shehzad et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards occur widely in the forests of Bhutan and Nepal. Leopards are widespread across India (Athreya et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Harihar et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009) and Sri Lanka (A. Kittle and A. Watson pers. comms. 2014) occurring inside and outside Protected Areas.<br/><br/><u>Southeast and East Asia</u>: Leopard range has been significantly reduced in southeast and East Asia. The North China Leopard is restricted to small, isolated protected areas in Central China in the Ningxia, northern Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, northern Henan, western Sichuan, southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet regions (Laguardia et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Leopards of southeast Asia have been confirmed in protected areas in Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia and southern China but are likely absent from Lao PDR and Viet Nam (S. Rostro-Garcia and J.F. Kamler unpubl. data). Some recent information indicates that they are still present in most forested regions of the island of Java, Indonesia but in very low numbers (H. Gunawan and H.A. Wahyudi pers. comms. 2015). In the Russian Far East, Leopards occur in a large area of about 7,000 km² along the eastern slopes of the East Manchurian Mountains on the border with China but their numbers are likely to be very low (Hebblewhite et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<p></p>","Leopards are targeted for trophy hunting and are illegally hunted for wildlife trade for their skins (used in traditional ceremonies), and bones and other parts (used for  medicinal purposes in eastern cultures).",Terrestrial,"The Leopard is included in CITES Appendix I. Trade of Leopard skins and products is restricted to 2,560 individuals in 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, the practices within the hunting industry have been called into question by wildlife researchers and conservationists (Packer et al.</em> 2011). In 2010, the government of Namibia conducted an assessment of trophy hunting in response to calls for an increase in permits amid reports of unethical hunting practices. Zambia placed a moratorium on Leopard and Lion hunting in 2013 due to concerns about the conservation status of the populations. In South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana, researchers have developed regional studies of the hunting quota systems that incorporate measures of trophy quality and regulate the geographic distribution of permits. These quota studies integrate previous hunting data to prescribe the number and distribution of hunting permits with local stakeholder participation.&#160; In 2014, sport hunting has been banned altogether in Botswana while South Africa suspended trophy hunting of Leopards&#160;for the year&#160;in&#160;2016.<br/><br/>Regulating trophy hunting will only address a percentage of Leopard mortality; human-Leopard conflict within livestock and game farming communities is likely the greatest source. In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, farmers are allowed to kill predators that are considered a threat to life and property with permits distributed retroactively. It is likely that a high percentage of Leopards are killed without reporting and therefore the exact numbers of Leopards killed through actual or perceived conflict is unknown. Generally, efforts to calculate mortality through human-wildlife conflict have been considered unreliable. Since the majority of Leopard range is outside of protected areas, conflict mitigation strategies such as livestock husbandry, compensation/ insurance programmes, alterations in trophy hunting permit distribution and public awareness have all been used to assist farmers and increasing tolerance for living with leopards (Balme et al.</em> 2009, Stein et al.</em> 2010). Where conflict Leopards have been identified, translocation has been tried often with negative results (Weilenmann et al.</em> 2010, Athreya et al.</em> 2011), however, effective translocation criteria have been developed based on suitable release site characteristics (Weise et al.</em> 2015). Namibia and Botswana have promoted wildlife conservation through the devolution of wildlife management and the establishment of benefit sharing initiatives between photographic tour operators, professional hunters and communities through Conservancies and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs; Jones 1993). These initiatives were modelled after previous efforts such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>In North and West Africa, the Middle East and large parts of Asia, Leopards are restricted to protected areas where they are afforded refuge if poaching is not significant. However, many of these protected areas are not large enough to maintain genetically viable populations and will likely require intensive management. In Indo-Malayasia and China, Leopards require increased protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007). In 2009, Leopards were protected from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan on the country’s Protected Species List (Zahler pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Since the previous status update, researchers have undertaken population surveys within protected areas throughout Leopard range. These surveys have improved our understanding of Leopard status with greater resolution and in some cases generated population estimates. We recommend increased population surveys for Leopards, in particular across Central Africa, Angola, South-east Asia and China.<br/><br/>To address the use of Leopard skins for traditional ceremonies, conservationists in South Africa have partnered with textile companies and communities to provide faux-fur alternatives (G. Balme pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Leopard population recovery efforts are currently under way with reintroduction projects in Sochi, Greater Caucasus and the Russian Far East (C.

50659951,15955,Panthera tigris,Endangered,A2abcd; C1,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Tiger is listed as Endangered under criterion A2abcd. Comparing a breeding recent range estimate (42 “source sites” totalling 90,000&#160; km² : Walston et al</em>. 2010b) to a 2006 total range estimate (1.1 million km² : Dinerstein et al</em>. 2007) suggests a range decline much greater than 50% over the last three generations (7 x 3 = 21 years). As per IUCN guidelines (Nowell et al</em>. 2007, IUCN 2013), we calculated generation length at seven years based on approximate age of maturity (four years) plus half the length of the reproductive lifespan (six years) (based on Smith and McDougal 1991 and unpublished information). This decline continues and at least two of the source populations listed in Walston et al</em>. (2010b) have apparently been lost (one from Lao PDR and one from Thailand). In 2006, it was believed that breeding populations existed in 13 countries, but now known breeding Tiger populations occur only in eight (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and Russia).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker et al</em>. 1999). A comparison of these population estimates of the 1990s (many with little scientific rigour) to similar current ones (many of better quality; see Table 1 in attached Supporting Material) suggests a decline of about 50% (taking the upper bound of 7,000 as the number of mature individuals in 1993, using a precautionary approach, declining to approximately 3,500 in 2014), but differences in methodologies and accuracy make such comparisons uncertain. This declining trend is likely to persist in the face of continuing threats such as direct poaching, prey depletion and habitat degradation which continue in all range states. Although several sites in India and Nepal have indeed reported recent recoveries, population reductions may not be reversible in other areas where Tiger habitat itself has been lost. Given the uncertainties about future declines, criterion A4bcd is no longer used.<br/><br/>The Tiger is also listed as Endangered under criterion C1 because the population of mature individuals may be fewer than 2,500 individuals. Walston et al</em>. 2010a estimated 2,154 tigers in 42 protected source sites where there is evidence of breeding (two populations are since known to have been lost, as described above), and the numbers in Table 1 (see Supporting material) could be overestimated. Generally Tiger status outside the source sites is poor and large breeding populations are unlikely to exist. To ensure tiger persistence, large population sizes (implying highest possible densities) and high survival rates of breeding adult females are critical. Although well-protected tiger populations may achieve recruitment rates that can sustain annual losses from mortality and emigration of 20% or more (Karanth et al</em>. 2006), some theoretical models suggest declines to extinction when annual mortality of breeding females exceeds 15% (Chapron et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston et al</em>. 2010b). For the purposes of Red List assessment, the estimated population in Source Sites is a good proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers. This population has declined by over 20% during the last two generations (14 years); the decline continues and may not be reversible in all sites.<br/><br/>Previously, Tigers were also listed under criterion C2a(i), but we have removed this criterion because the population in the Western Ghats in India has increased to &gt;250 adults (Karanth unpublished data). Other subpopulations in Terai, Central India, and Russia may also have &gt;250 adults (Karanth et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>See attached Supporting Material for alternative depictions of range and population details.","Tigers are found mainly in the forests of tropical Asia, although they historically occurred more widely in drier and colder climes. One subspecies, the Amur Tiger P. t. altaica</em>, persists in the Russian Far East. Photos of Tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the Tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the Tiger's diet, and in general Tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Hayward et al</em>. 2012, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Tigers need to kill 50-60 large prey animals per year (Karanth et al</em>. 2004, Miller et al</em>. 2013). Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines. Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (Water Buffalo, Gaur, Banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, like many large carnivores, preferred prey are key to successful reproduction and are those species that are approximately the same weight as Tigers themselves (Hayward et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges. Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1–3 females, a common felid pattern of social organization. Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - e.g., female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at about 400 km² (Goodrich et al</em>. 2010, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Similarly, reported Tiger densities range from a maximum of 17-19 Tigers per 100 km² where prey are abundant (India's Kaziranga and Corbett National Parks) to as low as 0.13–0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Jhala et al</em>. 2011, Soutyrina et al</em>. 2012).","Poaching for illegal trade in high-value Tiger products including skins, bones, meat and tonics is a primary threat to Tigers, which has led to their recent disappearance from broad areas of otherwise suitable habitat, and continues at unsustainable rates. That there are roughly one million square kilometres of unoccupied Tiger habitat is a clear indication that poaching is the greatest threat to Tigers range-wide.<br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable Tiger populations. Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of Tiger habitat loss. With their substantial dietary requirements, Tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of Tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for Tiger conservation and can lead to high rates of retaliatory killing of Tigers. In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, about 40 people were killed by Tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh and India 2000-2010 (Barlow et al</em>. 2013).<br/><p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","The thirteen Tiger Range Countries came together in an unprecedented pledge to double the world’s Tiger population by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger on the Asian lunar calendar, with a goal of achieving at least 6,000 Tigers. This figure was based on a baseline global population of 3,200, agreed upon at a preparatory workshop held in Kathmandu, Nepal in October 2009; 3,200 Tigers was the IUCN Red List population estimate at that time. Since then, Tiger Range Countries have adjusted their baseline national Tiger estimates, finalized in the Global Tiger Recovery Program adopted at the International Tiger Forum in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010 (GTRP 2010).<br/><br/>The global Tiger estimate published in the 2010 Red List assessment of 2,154 tigers was an updated version of the estimate of Tiger numbers in source sites (Walston et al</em>. 2010a). This was not a complete estimate of global Tiger numbers (for example, most Amur Tigers in Russia are found in unprotected areas), but justified because Tiger status outside the source sites is generally poor and poorly known. IUCN Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2010) define population as the number of mature individuals, defined as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction.” While in general this refers to all reproductive-age adults in the population, the Guidelines also “stress that the intention of the definition of mature individuals is to allow the estimate of the number of mature individuals to take account of all the factors that may make a taxon more vulnerable than otherwise might be expected.” Tigers require large populations to persist, and the survival rate of breeding adult females is a key parameter, with models suggesting population declines when mortality of breeding females rises over 15% (Chapron et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston et al</em>. 2010b). The IUCN Guidelines advise that “mature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted.” Thus, for the purposes of the Red List assessment in 2010, the estimated population in the Source Sites was used as a proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers.<br/><br/>Due to extensive surveys using improved methodologies since this analysis, our understanding of tiger distribution and numbers is much improved, e.g., extensive camera trapping in Bhutan has demonstrated significant populations. Further, Walston et al</em>. (2010a) ignored some important Tiger areas, e.g., thousands of square kilometres in Kerinci and Leuser National Parks known to contain breeding Tiger populations.&#160; Hence, the current estimate of 3,159 Tigers (Table 1 in supplementary material) is based on data collected in scientific surveys conducted over the past five years (i.e. since 2009). This is a minimum estimate because some important areas (e.g. the Russian Far East) did not have current estimates. However, because of differences in methodology, this can by no means be interpreted as an increase over the 2010 estimate of 2,154. Rather, it is a more complete counting. While Tiger numbers have increased in some areas in India (e.g. Western Ghats, Central India, and Corbett Landscapes in India), they have also declined in key areas, especially in mainland SE Asia (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey in Lao PDR is no longer considered a potential source site).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated, less rigorously, at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker et al</em>. 1999). Although to some extent the new numbers represent improved knowledge, it is clear that there have been substantial population declines, with Tigers all but eliminated from much of their recent forest range, particularly in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>See the supplementary material for further information about national Tiger population estimates.","Hence, the current estimate of 3,159 Tigers (Table 1 in supplementary material) is based on data collected in scientific surveys conducted over the past five years (i.e. since 2009). This is a minimum estimate because some important areas (e.g. the Russian Far East) did not have current estimates.",Decreasing,"The Tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Over the past 100 years Tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Tigers inhabit less than 6% of their historic range (Sanderson et al</em>. 2006, Walston et al.</em> 2010b), with a 42% decline since 2006. Breeding populations of Tigers are currently found in eight range states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, and Thailand. There is evidence of breeding in China and Myanmar between 2009 and 2014, though these populations are likely dependent on immigration from neighbouring countries. Tigers may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence.<br/><br/>In 1994, the first comprehensive assessment to delineate Tiger range was carried out (Dinerstein et al</em>. 1997). Priority areas for Tiger conservation were estimated to total 1.64 million km² in 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations, not including Russia (later estimated at 270,0000 km²: Sanderson et al</em>. 2006) and China. While this was generally considered representative of current distribution, Tiger presence was confirmed in just 47% the TCUs, and 89% were scored as undergoing medium to high levels of poaching of Tigers and their prey.<br/><br/>This exercise was revised and updated ten years later, and in delineating Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs), greater emphasis was placed on actual records of Tiger presence and breeding (Sanderson et al</em>. 2006). TCLs were defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five Tigers, and Tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade. Tiger range was estimated at 1.1 million km² in 76 TCLs (again, roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations). This represented a 41% decline from the range described a decade earlier (in South and Southeast Asia, a drop from 1.55 million km² to 914,000 km²: Sanderson et al</em>. 2006: 63), attributed primarily to poaching pressure (Dinerstein et al</em>. 2007). Habitat loss due to deforestation was also to blame, notable particularly in Sumatra and Myanmar (Wikramanayake et al</em>. 2010). In India, landscapes with Tigers found to be much smaller and more fragmented than in the original assessment (Sanderson et al</em>. 2006: 63 and Figure 4.12).<br/><br/>Records of Tigers were collected over a ten-year period (1995–2004), a period which may have been too liberal for places like Cambodia which underwent a sharp rise in poaching pressure in the 1990s (Sanderson et al</em>. 2006: Appendix 6). While 53% of the TCU survey respondents reported evidence of Tiger breeding in the time period 1995–2004, out of over 2,500 point records collected in 2005, just 8% had confirmed evidence of breeding Tigers (Sanderson et al</em>. 2006: 11-17). Large areas of habitat were defined as Tiger landscapes based on suitability, but given data paucity on Tiger presence there were often few records of breeding and actual Tiger occupancy to substantiate these (Sanderson et al</em>. 2006: Figures 2.3 and 4.8).<br/><br/>A review of land management within Tiger Conservation Landscapes described the TCLs as “potential habitat for Tigers” and found only 21% of their area to be legally protected.&#160; Management effectiveness was generally poor in the protected areas, with regulatory, budgetary and enforcement constraints, and hunting cited as the main threat. Significant portions of the TCLs are designated concessions for resource extraction (timber, oil and gas, minerals, etc.) (Forrest et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Tiger range was revisited again in 2009, by which time the extent of the Tiger’s range collapse had become evident. “Vast areas of Southeast Asia [were] recently found to be void of Tigers and depleted of prey by hunters” (Walston et al</em>. 2010a: 5). The exercise used a different methodology to prioritize areas for Tiger conservation.&#160; Source Sites were defined as areas with confirmed current presence of Tigers and evidence of breeding, population estimates of &gt;25 breeding females, legal protection, and embedded in a larger habitat landscape with the potential to hold &gt;50 breeding females. An extensive review of scientific literature as well as correspondence with Tiger scientists and protected area managers resulted in the identification of just 42 source sites totalling approximately 90,000 km².&#160; Many Southeast Asian countries, previously considered to have large areas with Tigers, were found, on the basis of extensive survey effort over the past decade or more, to have no healthy breeding populations. Since this publication, Lao PDR has lost its only source site, but Bhutan, originally listed as a country not containing source sites, has documented breeding populations. [See Figures 1 and 2 in supplementary material].<br/><br/>The map for this effort (Figure 1 in supplementary material) differentiates areas where breeding has been detected in the past five years (2009-2014), where Tigers, but no breeding have been detected in the past five years, areas surveyed where no Tigers were detected and areas not surveyed.&#160; Data include camera trap photos, DNA, and observations of Tigers and Tiger sign detected during scientific surveys.&#160; Unsurveyed areas were excluded from Tiger range.&#160; Figure 2 (attached Supporting Material)&#160; documents a 42% range decline since 2006, reflecting both real decline and improved knowledge from new and better surveys.","In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of Tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the Tiger to extinction (Nowell 2000). Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell 2007). Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu 2007). Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of Tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell 2007). In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of Tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching over 6,000. They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce Tiger products, and several have already engaged in illegal production of Tiger bone wine. Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of Tiger bone has decreased since China banned Tiger bone in 1993. Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu 2007). In 2008 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) adopted a Decision stating that “Tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives” (CITES 2008).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for Tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure. But many Tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock. Conflict-killed Tigers can also feed into the illegal trade. Many Tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger poaching is driven by less by poverty and more by wealth (TRAFFIC 2008), which is putting expensive illegal Tiger products within reach of a rapidly growing group of potential consumers. TRAFFIC has documented rising levels of recent illegal trade within the Tiger range countries, with seizures and confiscations in 2007–2009 averaging the equivalent of approximately 150 Tigers per year (Verheij <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Interdictions represent just a fraction of the true level of illegal trade, indicating that Tigers are gravely imperilled by black market demand.",Terrestrial,"At a “Tiger Summit” held in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010, the 13 Tiger Range Countries adopted a Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP 2010). The goal is to effectively double the number of wild Tigers by 2022 through actions to: <br/>i) effectively preserve, manage, enhance and protect Tiger habitats; <br/>ii) eradicate poaching, smuggling and illegal trade of Tigers, their parts and derivatives; <br/>iii) cooperate in transboundary landscape management and in combating illegal trade; <br/>iv) engage with indigenous and local communities; <br/>v) increase the effectiveness of Tiger and habitat management; and <br/>vi) restore Tigers to their former range. <br/><br/>The Tiger Summit was attended by Heads of State including Russia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Bangladesh, and represented significant government commitment to Tiger conservation.<br/><br/>The future of Tiger range depends upon the Asian governments creating effective Tiger landscapes by conserving large areas of suitable habitat. Within these landscapes, the most urgent need is to first secure the source sites—protected areas with viable Tiger populations—where most of the global Tiger population is now clustered, and many of which are currently too threatened to deliver their potential as the demographic sources for species recovery (Walston et al</em>. 2010b).<br/><br/>Countries that do not currently support known breeding populations (Myanmar, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR) but still have large landscapes with suitable habitat, Tigers might still be recovered if government commitment to Tigers, staff capacity for law enforcement and legal frameworks for Tiger protection can be established (Lynam 2010), though reintroduction may be needed in some places.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50664030,22732,Panthera uncia,Vulnerable,C1,2017,2016-11-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Snow Leopard is assessed as Vulnerable because the global population is estimated to number more than 2,500 but fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, and there is an estimated and projected decline of at least 10% over 22.62 years (3 generations). There have been five attempts to compile national estimates, of varying data quality, to determine global Snow Leopard global population size. Two sets contain estimates largely dating prior to 2003: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). Two sets date from 2008-2010: 4,500-7,500 (Jackson et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 4,678 to 8,745 (a compilation of individual population estimates for prime habitat covering about 1/3 of likely extant range developed at an expert mapping workshop in 2008 but not available until 2016: McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). The most recent set of national estimates comes from country chapters in the comprehensive book Snow Leopards</em>: 7,463 to 7,980 (McCarthy and Mallon 2016, Thinley et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016: Table 1 in the Supporting Information). While all these sets of estimates exclude dependent cubs, a population modelling exercise was carried out in 2015 to exclude young adults which may not be capable of breeding (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Model outputs for nine different scenarios were applied to the most conservative possible global population estimate available at the time (4,000), resulting in a number of mature individuals between 2,710 and 3,386. The number of mature individuals would be roughly double if applied to the upper bounds of the more recent estimates published in 2016.<br/><br/>There is virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales; Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others, including recent localized extinctions which may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union. A decline of at least 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction. Although poaching appears to have declined since the late 1990s, Nowell et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2016) estimated that 221-450 Snow Leopards were poached annually since 2008 (based on extrapolation of cases known to over 40 surveyed experts); these were attributed to retaliation for actual or perceived livestock depredation, but this supposition is not substantiated by hard evidence. With the average rate of poaching detection estimated by experts at less than 38%, these numbers could be substantially higher. If these poaching estimates are anywhere near accurate, this suggests that roughly 2-10% of the population could be poached annually. While a direct relationship between offtake and a population decline is not clear, even at the magnitude reported by Nowell et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, it adds to the plausibility of a 10% decline over 3 generations (22.62 years).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty</strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria are designed to incorporate the use of inference, suspicion and projection, to allow taxa to be assessed in the absence of detailed and complete data, which are rarely available across the entire range of a taxon; the absence of high-quality data should not deter attempts at applying the criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016). Throughout this assessment, we have attempted to show the degree to which we have dealt with uncertainty stemming from the paucity of data for this elusive and secretive species. To ensure this assessment is both “precautionary and credible,"" as specified by IUCN (2012), a range of values as well as best estimates were considered for the critical parameters, including those used in modelling the number of 'mature individuals' (MI) in the population. Specifically, the model dealt with uncertainty by including a variety of scenarios with cats maturing between 2 to 4 years of age, and then applied the resultant MI percent to the lowest published population estimate which, contrary to convention, included dependent yearlings (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Here, even the very lowest bound of the estimated range of mature individuals did not fall within the threshold for the Endangered category.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that precise and robust estimates of Snow Leopard density are difficult to obtain, are available for only a limited proportion of the global range, and represent small study sites selected for their suitability for the species. Because extrapolation to larger areas or even range-wide would be tenuous, we have avoided doing so in all cases. Estimates of Snow Leopard population size based on rigorous study design and survey methodology are sparse. The national population estimates cited here are considered to be the best available, following advice in the Red List Guidelines: “<strong>The plausible range may be established using.….. the opinion of a single expert, or the consensus view of a group of experts</strong>” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016).<br/><br/>There is also a lack of hard data on overall population trends, which hinders estimates of the magnitude of any decline which rely on fragmentary evidence and are therefore largely speculative. Nonetheless, the evidence considered does not suggest that the situation has deteriorated since 2008, which would be needed to justify an Endangered listing under criterion C1.<br/><br/><strong>Reasons for Change in IUCN Red List Status</strong><br/>The previous assessment in 2008 (Endangered C1) was based on &lt;2,500 mature  individuals and an estimated decline of 20% over 16  years (two generations). However, in that assessment, effective  population size  (Ne) was incorrectly used as a surrogate for ‘mature  individuals’ and  produces a lower figure (50% of the adult population of  4,080).  Therefore, the species should have been listed as Vulnerable in  2008.<br/><br/>Moreover, given the apparent limits to dispersal (Riordan et al.</em></em></em></em>   2015), it is questionable whether such a small number of individuals   capable of breeding (and therefore fewer actually breeding) is   demographically viable over such an extensive range. Recent survey   information indicates that Snow Leopard densities in several areas are   higher than previously believed, implying that the overall population   size is also likely to be larger than the minimum estimates (Jackson et  al.</em>  2010, SLSS 2014, McCarthy and Mallon 2016). The revised estimate of   the number of mature individuals addressed the earlier mistake, in   combination with new information, and the change from EN to VU is therefore a non-genuine change.<br/><br/>The   estimated 20% decline over 16 years in 2008 included a documented   upsurge in poaching for skins and body parts in the countries of Central   Asia, following the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1991. While   this threat has since subsided, it is unlikely to have completely   disappeared. The other traditional threats still exist, alongside   emerging potential threats such as mining and other infrastructure   development (roads, railroads, hydro-dams, etc.), some of which will have   intensified in recent years (summaries in Snow Leopard Network 2014,   McCarthy and Mallon 2016).<br/><br/>There have also been very significant   investments in conservation measures to reduce threats or to mitigate   their effects. These include: establishment of new protected areas in   Snow Leopard range; more effective anti-poaching measures; training and   capacity-building of range country conservation professionals; a number   of independent initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g.,   strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and   alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides); community engagement   programmes; the illegalization of guns in China since 1989; and   education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its   habitat (see the Conservation Measures</em> section for more details and  examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008  (Sanderson et al.</em></em></em></em>  2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem  Protection Program (Snow  Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the  revised version of the Snow  Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard  Network 2014) have all enhanced  the global strategic framework.<br/><br/>Although  the Snow Leopard undoubtedly is still threatened, the  measures listed  above are collectively considered to have contributed  to improving the  overall conservation situation for Snow Leopards since  2008. The  generation length of 8 years used in 2008 has been revised to 7.54 years  following Pacifici et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013).  There is no current evidence to  support a decline of 20% over such a  short period of 15.08 years, as  needed to support a listing as  Endangered, and which would represent a  steeper decline and therefore a  deterioration in the situation since  2008. However, in view of the  existing and emerging threats, a decline  of 10% or more over 22.62  years (three generations) is considered plausible  (starting in 2014). This  change in the estimated rate of decline is the  result of conservation  actions taken, so potentially could qualify as genuine change and  on this basis IUCN's 5-year waiting period would apply, dated from the first  draft of this  assessment (June 2014).&#160;However, since the EN category in 2008  was incorrect, the species should have been listed as VU in 2008, the  change in category is therefore non-genuine.","Snow Leopards inhabit mountainous rangelands at elevations of 3,000 to over 5,000 m in the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, but can occur as low as 500 m in the Altai (Snow Leopard Network 2014). Wild caprids are the principal natural prey of Snow Leopards, especially Blue Sheep (Pseudois nayaur</em>) and Siberian Ibex </em>(Capra sibirica</em>), whose distribution coincides closely with Snow Leopard range. Argali (Ovis ammon) </em>and Markhor (Capra</em> falconeri</em>) are also important prey in some areas. Primary productivity in Snow Leopard habitat is relatively low due to low temperatures and high aridity, consequently, the density of ungulate prey also tends to be relatively low, with reports ranging from 0.9 to 10.2 animals per km² (e.g., Suryawanshi et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Wild prey abundance is one of the main determinants of Snow Leopard abundance (Suryawanshi et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Snow Leopard diet is dominated by wild caprids, reportedly contributing 45% to 98% of the diet, while livestock may contribute 40-70%, though generally more on the order of 15-30% (Schaller et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987, Oli et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>1994, Chundawat and Rawat 1994, Jackson 1996, Bagchi and Mishra 2006, Anwar et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Shezad et al.</em></em> 2012, Jumabay-Uulu et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Smaller prey reported in Snow Leopard diet (approximately 12–25%) include marmots (Marmota </em>spp.), pika (Ochotona </em>spp.), hares (Lepus </em>spp.), small rodents, and birds. It appears that the contribution of small sized prey in Snow Leopard diet may have been overestimated in earlier studies due to inadvertent inclusion of scats of other carnivores such as foxes (Vulpes</em> spp.) in the analyses of Snow Leopard diet. Results of recent studies that have confirmed the identity of scats through faecal DNA (e.g., Anwar et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Jumabay-Uulu et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>2013) or examined prey DNA in scats (Shezad et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>2012) report the contribution of small sized prey to be relatively low (2-8%).<br/><br/>Although Snow Leopards may occur in relatively flat or rolling areas such as in parts of Mongolia and the Tibetan Plateau (Schaller 1998, McCarthy 2000), within their habitat, they favour steep, rugged and broken terrain and rocky outcrops (Jackson et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Mountain ridges, cliff edges, and well-defined drainage lines serve as common travel routes and sites for the deposition of signs, including scrapes, scats, and scent marks (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988).<br/><br/>There is substantial variation in the reported home range sizes of Snow Leopards. An earlier study in Nepal based on ground-based very high frequency (VHF) tracking reported home ranges of five individuals between 12 and 39 km², with substantial overlap between individuals and sexes (Jackson and Ahlborn 1989). However, the home range of a single Snow Leopard radio-collared in 2013 in Nepal using a satellite collar was estimated to be &gt; 400 km² (Rinjan Shreshtha, WWF, pers. comm). McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em> </em>(2005) reported home range size of four Snow Leopards based on VHF tracking in Mongolia to range between 13 and 141 km², while the satellite-monitored home range of one of these individuals in the same study was at least 15 times higher. In the most current and comprehensive study to have been undertaken, home ranges of 18 individuals monitored between 2008 and 2014 using Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite telemetry in Mongolia ranged from approximately 100 to &gt;1,000 km² (SLT, Panthera and SLCF, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>A four-year camera trapping study in Mongolia reveals considerable underlying dynamics in an otherwise stable population of Snow Leopards, with the adult sex ratio apparently changing from being male-biased to female-biased during the study period (1.67 to 0.38 males per female, Sharma et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This is the first study to estimate vital rates including probabilities of immigration and emigration. The adult survival probability for the study population was estimated at 0.83 (Sharma et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","Appendix 2 of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) provides a global and country-by-country threat assessment based on the GSLEP-supported exercise drawing loosely on the Threats Reduction Assessment (TRA) protocol of Salafsky and Margoluis (1999) and involving select experts from each range country. McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: <br/><br/>Recently Nowell et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","There are no robust estimates of Snow Leopard global population size and the various figures available are best regarded as guesses: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003); 4,500-7,500 (Jackson et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). There are several difficulties to overcome in making reliable estimates of Snow Leopard population size (Snow Leopard Network 2014), namely this species’ secretive nature, generally low density, sparse (or sporadic) distribution and remote terrain contributing to generally low detection rates and small sample sizes that in turn may make extrapolation problematic. Until recently, most studies were conducted over rather small areas, sometimes smaller than the home range of a single Snow Leopard, rendering the information inadequate to make population and density inferences over larger areas (Appendix 1 in Snow Leopard Network 2014). Furthermore, not all studies report the size of the surveyed area, thus precluding generation of density estimates. These limitations are starting to be addressed, for example through the adoption of more robust methods, such as spatially-explicit recapture models from camera data (e.g., Shrestha et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Thinley et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Alexander et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Additionally, recently published information includes relatively rigorous surveys conducted over larger areas (see below).<br/><br/>Snow Leopards are known to breed at 2 or 3 years of age (Leif Blomqvist, International Snow Leopard Studbook Keeper, Helsinki Zoo, pers. comm., Jay Tetzloff, US Association of Zoos and Aquariums Snow Leopard Species Survival Plan Coordinator, pers. comm., McCarthy and Chapron 2003). Field observations are consistent with Snow Leopards breeding at 2 or 3 years of age. Of two known-age females in a long-term radio-telemetry study of Snow Leopards in Mongolia, one gave birth at the age of 3 years and the other at age 3 or 4 years (O. Johansson, pers. comm. and Panthera/Snow Leopard Trust unpublished data). Since breeding occurs in February/March and birth occurs in May/June, this means that one female definitely bred at age 2 years and the second bred when either 2 or 3 years old. Two other females of estimated age in the same study likely gave birth when 3-4 years old, again indicating successful breeding at 2-3 years old. Sexual maturity and breeding at 2-3 years old appears to be consistent across a range of large wild felids (Berry et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Hunter 1998, Kelly et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Balme et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Hunter et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Miller 2013, Miller and Funston 2014).<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016) define 'mature individuals' as individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction. The guidelines also state that age of first reproduction in the wild may be later than the age at which an individual is biologically capable of breeding. Hence, mature individuals in the Red List context are those capable of breeding, not just those actually breeding in any given year. Snow Leopards are capable of breeding beginning at 2 years of age and thus meet the IUCN definition of mature individuals, even if they do not actually start to breed this young.<br/><br/>Estimating the percent of mature individuals (≥  2 years of age) in the wild Snow Leopard population has been historically difficult, but with the extensive application of camera trapping new information is available. In 21 camera trapping studies conducted in 6 countries between 2003 and 2014 and comprising more than 29,165 trap-nights, a mean of 82.3% of Snow Leopards captured in photos were independent animals (Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information). Snow Leopards become independent at between 18 and 26 months old, hence, a small percent of independent cats in camera trap photos may not yet have reached the mature age class (2-year olds).<br/><br/>With few exceptions, published felid population estimates do not include dependent cubs. Camera-trapping derived density estimates are an example where exclusion of cubs applies. The global population estimate of 4,080-6,590 Snow Leopards (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) only includes mature individuals. Similarly, the 2008 Red List assessment (Jackson et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008) for Snow Leopard states that the population estimate is for adults only and the authors calculate effective population size (2,040) as 50% of the estimated total number of adults (4,080), citing Nowell et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007). Hence, for the purposes of estimating the percent of mature individuals, published Snow Leopard population estimates should be considered to be comprised of adults only.<br/><br/>Population modelling can be used to estimate the percent of individuals in each age class. McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015 (Appendix 2 in supplementary material) employed a stochastic age-structured population model to produce a suite of stable stage population matrices. Vital rate input variables included the age at which Snow Leopards become capable of reproduction (mature), and the percentage of each age class that actually bred. The proportion of yearlings in the population estimate varied in the model from 0% to 50%. The model was run using nine scenarios of various combinations of vital rates and percentages of yearlings in the population. The lowest percentage of mature individuals (MI) was obtained when 2-year old maturity rates were lowest (25%), actual breeding did not begin until age 3, and the proportion of cubs in the population estimate was highest (50%). Yet even in that most precautionary scenario a mean MI of 67.7% (s.d. = 2.07) was obtained. Applying that MI percent to the most conservative global population estimate of 4,000 individuals, yields 2,710 (s.d. = 83) mature individuals. Model outputs for all nine scenarios when applied to this minimum population of 4,000 ranged from 2,710 to 3,386 MI. In no case did MI fall below the threshold required for an Endangered designation for the species.<br/><br/>A population of &lt; 2,500 mature individuals distributed across 1,776,000 km² (taking a relatively conservative estimate of global range size from Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) or a maximum of 3,300,000 km² (Snow Leopard Network 2014) equates to a density of one Snow Leopard capable of reproduction per 710 km² or 1,320 km² respectively. We question how such a scenario would be demographically viable; and in fact, recent best-practice density estimates largely range from 1 to over 3 per 100 km² for areas surveyed to date (see below).<br/><br/>Doubt is also being cast on the lower estimates of the global Snow Leopard population size through the expansion of field surveys in recent years and the application of more sophisticated and reliable survey techniques (such as systematic camera trapping, faecal genotyping and satellite collaring). Recent studies have confirmed the presence of Snow Leopards in new areas or their reappearance in former areas. Snow Leopards returned to the Sagarmatha area, Nepal, in 2002-2003 after an absence of ca</em> 25 years (Lovari et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ferretti et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Snow Leopard presence in the Vakhan Range of Tajikistan was confirmed by camera-trapping for the first time in 2011 (Diment et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and in the Kizilsu area of the Gissar Nature Reserve in Uzbekistan in 2013 (Panthera, unpublished data). In other areas, studies have indicated stable or even circumstantial evidence of increasing populations. In Wakhan District (10,000 km²) in Afghanistan, the National Environmental Protection Agency reports that numbers of Snow Leopards and one of their main prey, argali Ovis ammon</em>, have increased in recent years (www.khaama.org 06 August 2015). The Snow Leopard population in Tost Uul, South Gobi, Mongolia, has been the object of the most intensive (and reliable) research to date using satellite collaring and camera trapping and was reported to be stable during the course of four years of study (Sharma et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This site was completely unprotected until recently.<br/><br/>A review of the majority of camera trap and genetic surveys to date indicate densities in excess of 1.5 adults per 100 km². Densities of 0.87-2.85 and 0.32-1.62 per 100 km² were reported at two sites in the Eastern Pamirs (Kachel 2014). In Bhutan, there is a “bright future for Snow Leopards” (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016) and density in Wangchuk Centennial Park, Bhutan was estimated at 2.39/100 km² by Shrestha et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2013). Thinley et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2014) found even higher densities in Bhutan’s Jigme Dorji National Park (6.2/100 km²) and estimated that the protected area could harbour as many as 192 Snow Leopards, which is nearly equal to the high end of the estimate for the entire country (200). At six sites in Ladakh-Spiti, India, densities were 0.45, 0.74, 1.17, 1.66, 1.94, and 3.3 per 100 km² (Suryawanshi et al</em>. 2013). Density in Sarychat-Ertash State Reserve, Kyrgyzstan, was 1.38 per 100 km² (Jumabay-uulu et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which is a reserve that Koshkarev and Vyrypaev (2000) pointed to as having been ‘absolutely trapped out’, with surveys in 1999 finding no sign of Snow Leopards after the post-Soviet declines earlier that decade.<br/><br/>In China, Snow Leopard presence has been confirmed at numerous locations across all parts of the range, including areas where the species was thought to have disappeared such as Inner Mongolia (Riordan and Shi 2016). The Second National Biodiversity Survey of China being undertaken by the State Forestry Administration suggests that there have been improvements for Snow Leopard and their ecosystems across the country since the first assessment reported in 1995. Snow Leopard populations in the Sanjiangyuan region are believed to have increased in the last 20 years along with those of a major prey species, Blue Sheep (Pseudois nayaur</em>) (Liu et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Camera-trap surveys in Suojia (also in Sanjiangyuan) indicated densities of 3.1/100 km² (Li 2012). Alexander et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015), using spatially-explicit recapture models, reported 3.31 Snow Leopards/100 km² in the Qilian Shan range, where surveys in the 1980s suggested densities &lt; 1/100 km². Schaller (2014) resurveyed portions of the Qilian Shan range in Qinghai 29 years after he first surveyed the area and although direct comparisons were not made they saw more Snow Leopard sign and more Blue Sheep in their recent surveys. Qinghai Forestry Department recently increased their estimate for the province to at least 1,000 individuals based on camera trapping surveys (Liu et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Riordan and Shi (2016) estimate Snow Leopard populations for each province in China, totalling at least 4,500 for the whole country. Since China contains c. 60% of the overall range this figure implies that the global population may possibly reach 7,500, broadly in line with the upper estimates described above. The current situation for Snow Leopard in China is a result of new information emerging as survey effort improves, as well as positive effects of the illegalization of firearms in China in 1989, along with hunting bans in key provinces, and greater awareness of the national importance of Snow Leopards.<br/><br/>Some, but not all, of the recent studies have been in protected areas or locations thought to have good populations of Snow Leopards, so densities might be higher there than elsewhere, and thus these figures are not easily extrapolated to the entire range. However, taken together, and considering the widely spread localities within the overall distribution of Snow Leopards, these figures do seem to suggest that the global population size is closer to the upper end of the estimates cited above, rather than the lower end.<br/><br/>Two sets of global population estimates published in 2015, after the modelling exercise in Appendix 2 (in the Supporting Information) was carried out, also suggest that Snow Leopard numbers are higher than previously estimated in 2003. In 2008, an expert knowledge process was used to map current Snow Leopard range and identify important Snow Leopard Conservation Units (SLCUs) within that range (McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Experts from all range states and global experts participated and identified 69 SLCUs. Adequate information was available to estimate Snow Leopard population size in 56 SLCUs, placing it at 4,678 to 8,745 adults and large sub-adults within an area of 875,818 km², or about 31.5% of currently occupied range. The population trend was considered to be stable or increasing in 33 (48%) of SLCUs and decreasing in only 15 (22%), while no information on trend was reported by experts in 11 (30%) of the units. Notably, experts indicated that most population and trend estimates they provided came from recent research as opposed to previous ‘guesstimates’ lacking field-based evidence.<br/><br/>With the recent publication of the first ever comprehensive book on the species (McCarthy and Mallon 2016), additional light has been shed on current Snow Leopard population estimates in most of the 12 range countries. National experts authored individual chapters providing updates on the status of the species in their home countries. With the exception of Bhutan those chapters included current population estimates; taking the high and low values of the population ranges provided (Table 1 in the Supporting Information) a range-wide population of 7,367-7,884 is indicated. If the results of the 2014-2016 Bhutan Snow Leopard census are added in (79-112: Thinley et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016), the global population would then be estimated at 7,446 to 7,996. This indicates that Snow Leopards are likely more numerous than historic estimates suggest, perhaps substantially so. It should be noted that this represents better knowledge and not necessarily a population increase.<br/><br/>There is little evidence to indicate that small-scale fragmentation and lack of connectivity are significant issues, despite the typically insular nature of mountain habitat and the species’ preference for steep or broken terrain. Most of Snow Leopard range is more or less contiguous and it is difficult to delimit separate subpopulations (Jackson, unpub. data; Janecka, unpub. data); furthermore, other than major rivers along the periphery of Snow Leopard range, some border fences, and short sections of railroads or major highways, there currently appear to be few major barriers to restrict movement. The Mongolia telemetry study has confirmed that Snow Leopards are capable of crossing open habitat (desert plains) in excess of 100 km (Panthera/SLT unpublished data) and Snow Leopards have been encountered attempting to cross the Chinese Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia on at least three occasions (Riordan et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, Nei Mongol Wildlife Division, pers. comm). Riordan et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015) used resistant kernel modelling to assess connectivity and predicted two regional populations, in the north and south of the species range, and identified several potentially important connecting areas. Snow Leopard range in Nepal lies in five “relatively contiguous habitat blocks” (Ale et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); in Pakistan, there is “confirmed presence over large landscapes” (Ud-Din and Nawaz.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); the range in Bhutan is virtually contiguous across the whole of the north of the country (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016); in Sanjiangyuan region, a key Snow Leopard habitat in China, “there are abundant connections between important habitats” (Li 2012, Liu et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Current Population Trend</strong>:<br/>Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others. Recent localized extinctions may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union (Taubmann et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Evidence of increased or re-established populations described above may in some cases be a consequence of enhanced survey effort in previously unsurveyed areas, although conservation actions and policies will have no doubt helped. However, there remains a lack of sufficiently longitudinal surveys, except in very few sites, and thus we have virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales. This is an information gap that urgently needs to be filled in order to validate this and all future Red List assessments and provide a reliable basis from which to evaluate conservation actions and measure their impact.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Past </strong><br/>Population reductions in the Central Asian republics—which represent only 7% of the global occupied range (McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016)—following the collapse of the Soviet Union are thought to have been as high as 40-75% during the 1990s. There is no evidence to indicate such high rates of decline continued beyond the late 1990s.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Future</strong> <br/>Recent surveys in Pakistan suggest that Snow Leopard numbers in parts of the country may be lower than previously thought (Snow Leopard Foundation, unpublished reports, Nawaz and Hameed 2015) and may experience further decline in the future. Localized extinctions, such as those documented by Taubmann et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) in parts of the Alay region of Kyrgyzstan, may be expected in other isolated sites in Central Asia. There are also growing threats from extractive industries across the species’ range and potential impacts from climate change which may influence population trends. Despite positive conditions described previously, a decline of 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated in light of localized declines given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction (see below). However, projecting rural development more than 3-5 years into the future is difficult, even in countries with well-articulated 5-10 year Development Plans, environmental impact laws or robust protocols for forecasting economic growth.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Population Reduction - Ongoing</strong> <br/>Current reductions appear to be modest and local, likely driven by a declining natural prey base, localized poaching for skins, and sporadic but apparently increasing human-wildlife conflict resulting from depredation of livestock. Growing flocks of sheep and goats and a thriving meat (e.g., Nepal and Pakistan) and cashmere trade (China and Mongolia) appear to lie at the root of these inter-connected threats (Berger et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). However, where not mitigated, the mix of livestock-wild ungulate competition, associated rangeland degradation, declining natural prey numbers and Snow Leopard predation of livestock would likely accelerate retributive killing by herders, who could also be expected to offset their economic losses by funnelling Snow Leopard body parts into the illegal trade network.",,Decreasing,"The range of the Snow Leopard extends from the Himalaya in the south, across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the mountains of Central Asia to the mountains of southern Siberia in the north. It occurs in the Altai, Sayan, Tien Shan, Kunlun, Pamir, Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and outer Himalayan ranges and in smaller isolated mountains in the Gobi region. It occurs in 12 countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A small area of potential range occurs in northern Myanmar but recent Snow Leopard presence has not been confirmed. The area of occupied range was recently estimated to be about 2.8 million km² (McCarthy et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","Poaching and illegal trade has been a traditional threat and continues in many parts of the range. Currently, the demand for rugs, luxury décor, and taxidermy, especially from China and Eastern Europe appears on the increase (EIA 2012). In China, that holds the largest Snow Leopard population, trade in Snow Leopard pelt and bones, which was earlier restricted to Snow Leopard range provinces, is reported to also be emerging in the wealthier coastal cities since 2010 (Li and Lu 2014). The extent of illegal trade was reviewed by Maheshwari and Von Meibom (2016).",Terrestrial,"Very significant investments in conservation have been made. These include: establishment of new protected areas within the Snow Leopard range; anti-poaching measures; training and capacity-building; initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g. strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides), community engagement programmes; illegalization and confiscation of firearms across China, and education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its habitat (see Conservation Measures section for more details and examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008 (Sanderson et al.</em></em> 2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the revised version of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) have all enhanced the global strategic framework for conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Illegal poaching, the main threat to Russia's Snow Leopard population, was recently alleviated, at least in several important areas, by concerted removal of wire-snares and the recruitment of former poachers as protected area rangers (Paltsyn et al.</em></em> 2016). Anti-poaching efforts in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have also been strengthened, thus addressing the main underlying threat that led to the drastic decline in numbers in several Central Asia states following the break-up of the Soviet Union 25 years ago.<br/><br/>In terms of protected area establishment and enhancement, the whole of Wakhan District Afghanistan (&gt;10,000 km²) has been declared the country’s second national park (Moheb and Paley 2016). Sarychat Ertash State Reserve, a key site in Kyrgyzstan, has recently been enlarged by 150 km² and mining concessions withdrawn (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015), and several projects have worked on management planning, training and monitoring and/ or provided substantial amounts of equipment (Hotham et al.</em></em> 2016). Tost Uul, a key site in Mongolia’s South Gobi, was declared a local nature reserve in 2010 (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a>, 4 October 2015). Capacity building in Zorkul State Reserve in the Eastern Pamir of Tajikistan includes development of a new management plan, training programmes, and substantial donations of equipment (Mallon and Diment 2013). The role of Buddhist monasteries in providing effective protection around monasteries was highlighted by Li et al.</em></em> (2014). The GSLEP initiative, along with conservation practitioners have been highlighting customary beliefs of Snow Leopards as important totem animals for select traditional communities across this species' range.<br/><br/>A number of transboundary projects provide important conservation benefits to Snow Leopards across their range (Rosen and Zahler 2016). Two transboundary or landscape-level projects are currently operating in Central Asia (Mallon and Kulikov 2015): The Khan Tengri nature conservation park (3,257 km²) has been designated in eastern Kyrgyzstan that will link Naryn Reserve, Sarychat Ertash Reserve, and two others in Kyrgyzstan with Tomur Nature Reserve in China; a transboundary project is currently operating in the northern Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan) with Snow Leopard as a focal species and with the aim of developing cooperation and enhancing protected areas. The UNDP/GEF Altai-Sayan Project (2007-2012) also identified the Snow Leopard as one of its focal species and carried out a series of transboundary projects including camera trapping, and training (WWF 2012).<br/><br/>Many incentive programs have been initiated (reviewed in Mishra et al.</em></em> 2003 and see chapters in McCarthy and Mallon 2016). One oft-cited threat is the killing of Snow Leopards by herders in retaliation for predation on livestock, exacerbated by occasions when many sheep or goats are killed in a single attack by a Snow Leopard gaining entry to poorly constructed or maintained night-time corrals. Remedial measures have involved strengthening corrals to make them predator-proof. To date, over 260 corrals have been strengthened in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Tajikistan with the result that no subsequent livestock predation occurred (Mohammad et al.</em></em> 2016, Moheb and Paley 2016). A similar programme in Western Tyva, Russia protected corrals in 46 herder camps, and since 2008 no predation occurred in any of them and annual losses of livestock fell by 50-60% (Paltsyn et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Innovative community programmes have been established in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with new governance structures created (over 65 in Pakistan) aimed at local natural resource management, and with over 50 rangers in the Afghan Wakhan and over 100 rangers in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan monitoring wildlife and enforcing local and national regulations against poaching and other resource extraction activities (Zahler and Paley 2016). A programme has been pioneered by the Snow Leopard Trust in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to increase local incomes by providing training in the manufacture of handicrafts and access for the finished products to international markets in return for a commitment to prevent poaching of Snow Leopards and their prey and to engage in environmental education and other activities. These programmes have proved successful and have had additional benefits (Bayarjargal et al.</em></em> 2016). In Kyrgyzstan, no Snow Leopards or prey were poached during 2014 in any of the partner communities (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015). Incentives related to ecotourism have led to a surge in Snow Leopard sightings in Hemis National Park, Ladakh (India), attributed to a combination of corral predator-proofing and meaningful income generation associated with community-managed homestays first initiated in 2007 (Jackson and Wangchuk 2004, Wangchuk et al.</em></em> 2010, Jackson 2015, Namgail and Dadul 2016). With these local communities now perceiving Snow Leopards positively instead of pests to be killed or chased away, this notoriously elusive big cat is now being regularly observed from distances as close as 50-200 meters, especially during its mating season in winter.<br/><br/>In addition to these programmes, other conservation initiatives include grazing set-asides (village reserves; Mishra et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock vaccination (Nawaz et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock insurance (Kunkel et al.</em></em> 2016) and a range of education and awareness projects (Hillard et al.</em></em> 2016). Conservation initiatives that blend conservation science with traditional knowledge, and which mitigate Snow Leopard-related human-wildlife conflict, improve household incomes for households dependent upon livestock, and that highlight the cultural and ecological importance of Snow Leopards are also most likely to be embraced by local people who likely represent the effective and cost-efficient stewards for this felid's remote mountain landscapes (Jackson and Brewer-Lama 2016).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
97164299,16218,Pardofelis marmorata,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Marbled Cat is listed as Near Threatened although it is close to qualifying as Vulnerable under criteria A and C. The change in status from Vulnerable in the 2008 assessment to Near Threatened must not be taken to reflect an actual increase in population nor a reduction of threats, rather the increasing number of camera trap surveys across Asia have, in recent years, confirmed the presence of previously only suspected populations and in some areas have resulted in a higher than expected number of detections and individuals. Despite this, the Marbled Cat remains little known and, across its range, is recorded relatively infrequently, which has hampered efforts to accurately assess its status, so much so that the assessors could not make a unanimous decision, with some assessors believing that maintaining the status as Vulnerable was more appropriate, we therefore report Near Threatened as the view of the majority. Current data suggest the Marbled Cat is forest dependent but does persist in degraded forest. It is also present over a wide elevation range and in rugged areas – areas in which forest loss is slower than average for the region. Marbled Cats are also threatened by hunting, but currently quantitative data is lacking and we cannot assess the impact this is having on the population. There are no published estimates of population density for the Marbled Cat, however, across its range, density probably varies considerably, but given the large range (currently estimated at roughly 1,500,000 km²) the population density needs to be below one individual per 100 km² to qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals), this seems implausible in several areas. In summary, the population is probably slightly too large and declining too slowly (c</em>. 25%) to qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>If future research challenges these key assumptions (presence in rugged terrain, over wide elevations, large geographic range, tolerance to some habitat degradation) or provides evidence of a substantially fragmented population, extremely low population density, heavy hunting pressure, or stronger support of the proposed species split, the status will need revising and it is likely that it would then qualify for Vulnerable, probably under criterion C.","<p>Current data suggest that the Marbled Cat is forest dependent, primarily associated with moist and mixed deciduous-evergreen tropical forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and may prefer hill forest (Duckworth et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Grassman et al.</em></em></em> 2005). The increasing use of camera traps throughout its range is revealing detections from disturbed areas (e.g. Mohamed et al</em>. 2009, Mathai et al.</em></em>&#160;2010), including recently logged forest (e.g. Ross et al</em>. 2010), but surveys of oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo have not detected marbled cats within the plantations (Ross et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Yue et al</em>. 2015). Grassman and Tewes (2002) reported a pair of adult Marbled Cats in a salt lick in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat has never been intensively studied, but Grassman et al.</em></em></em> (2005) report a preliminary home range estimate of 5.3 km² for an adult female who was radio-collared and tracked for one month in Thailand's Phu Khieu National Park. There is no detailed information regarding Marbled Cat diet, but it probably preys primarily on rodents, including squirrels (Nowell and Jackson 1996), and birds.<br/><br/>The Marbled Cat appears to be primarily diurnal (Ross et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Lynam et al.</em></em></em>&#160;</em>2013).</p>","<p>  The Marbled Cat is forest dependent and forest loss and degradation is continuing across its range from logging and expansion of human settlements and agriculture, including oil palm plantations. The Marbled Cat is valued for skin, meat and bones, although it is infrequently observed in the wildlife trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, it is possible that illegal killing and trade is underreported compared to other species. Targeted and indiscriminate snaring are prevalent throughout much of the range and likely to pose a significant threat. They have been reported as poultry pests (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mishra et al.</em> 2006) which also results in retaliatory killing. Records of hunting and skins are known from several areas in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India - Vijaynagar-Gandhigram in Changlang district (A. Datta unpubl. data), West Kameng district (Mishra et al.</em> 2006), Pakke Kessang, East Kameng district (Lyngdoh et al.</em> 2011), Ziro valley, Lower Subansiri (Selvan et al.</em> 2013) and from Khonoma in Nagaland (Grewal et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>There are no population density estimates for the Marbled Cat. In most surveys, detection rates tend to be lower for this species than some sympatric felids such as the Asiatic Golden Cat (e.g. Pusparini et al</em>. 2014, Gumal et al</em>. 2014, Than Zaw et al.</em></em>&#160;2014) and both species of Clouded Leopard, but higher than others such as the Bay Cat (Ross et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2010, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). However, in some surveys, when individual animals have been identified, a similar number or even a higher number of individual Marbled Cats compared to Clouded Leopards have been found (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpubl. data). It is therefore possible that low detection rates may under some circumstances arise from cameras placed inappropriately for Marbled Cats, it is also likely that the population density will vary greatly across the range and it is important to note that many surveys have resulted in very few detections. However, unless population densities are very low, or the distribution extremely patchy it is likely that the total population numbers over 10,000 mature individuals, although this is certainly in decline.</p>",,Decreasing,"<p>The Marbled Cat is found from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal eastwards into southwest China, southwards throughout mainland Southeast Asia and on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.

50661611,18146,Prionailurus bengalensis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread and relatively common species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), although the island subspecies P. b. iriomotensis </em>is assessed separately in the Red List because the population is small and isolated.&#160; Across its range, threats vary enormously by region, in the Western Ghats in India, for example, it is threatened by urbanisation (Seto et al.</em> 2012), while in Viet Nam (Wilcox et al.</em> 2014) and Lao PDR (Coudrat et al.</em> 2014ab) direct and indirect hunting are potentially causing large population declines. Across the majority of its range, however, this species appears to be stable and to readily use degraded forest (e.g. Mohamed et al.</em> 2013) and even heavily modified habitats such as oil palm (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data, Yue et al.</em> in press) and sugar cane plantations (Lorica and Heaney 2013). Consequently the Leopard Cat does not currently meet the criteria for any of the threatened categories. It is listed as Least Concern.","Leopard Cats can range up to 3,240 m asl (Ghimirey and Ghimire 2010) and occur in a wide variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to temperate broadleaf and, marginally, coniferous forest, as well as shrub forest and successional grasslands. The northern boundary of its range is limited by snow cover, as the Leopard Cat does not occur in deep snow (but see Kerley and Bosienko 2013). It is not found in the cold steppe grasslands, and generally does not occur in arid, treeless areas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Leopard Cats occur commonly in dense secondary growth, including logged forest (Ross&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Mohamed et al.</em></em> 2013) and have been found in Acacia (Giman et al.</em></em> 2007), oil palm (Ross&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Yue et al.</em></em> in press, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data) and sugarcane (Lorica and Heaney 2013) plantations. A camera trap study in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo found that both number of individuals and overall detections of Leopard Cats were higher in a small oil palm plantation with shorter distances to the nearest forest compared to a large plantation, suggesting that although Leopard Cats do use oil palm areas, forest habitat remains important (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data). It is still unknown how dependent Leopard Cats in oil palm plantations are on surrounding forest, or the maximum distances they will move into plantations, or even if plantations support stable populations. Leopard Cats can also live close to rural settlements. They are excellent swimmers, and have successfully colonized offshore islands throughout their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>From 20 radio-collared Leopard Cats in Phu Khieu Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, Grassman et al.</em></em> (2005) report mean home ranges of 12.7 km<sup>2</sup>, larger than that reported for other radio-collared Leopard Cats in Thailand (4.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005) or on Borneo (roughly 3.0&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Rajaratnam 2007, Hearn and Ross, unpublished data) or Iriomote Island (Schmidt et al.</em></em> 2003). Grassman et al.</em></em> (2005) found no significant difference between the range sizes of males and females. They also found that habitat use was in proportion to occurrence. Rajaratnam et al.</em></em> (2007) report that Leopard Cats used oil palm plantations for hunting but forest fragments were important for resting and breeding. This was also seen in Sumatra, where Leopard Cats have been frequently recorded in remnant forest fragments in and amongst coffee plantations (McCarthy, unpublished data).<br/><br/>Murids have been shown to dominate the diet (Rabinowitz 1990, Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005, Rajaratnam et al.</em></em> 2007, Shehzad et al.</em></em> 2012). Other small mammals, eels and fish have also been reported, as well as occasional scavenging of carrion (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/><br/>The Leopard Cat is predominantly nocturnal (Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005, Cheyne and Macdonald 2011, Lynam et al.</em></em> 2013, McCarthy et al.</em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald, unpublished data), with crepuscular peaks in some areas (Grassman et al.</em></em> 2005) but some diurnal activity has been recorded (e.g. Saxena and Rajanshi 2014, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data).","In China, commercial exploitation has been heavy: hundreds of thousands of Leopard Cat skins per year were exported in the 1980s. Although commercial trade is now much reduced (Yu 2010) this species continues to be hunted throughout most of its range for fur, for food and as pets. They are also widely viewed as poultry pests and killed in retribution. In villages around Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park on Sumatra, chicken depredation was frequently attributed to Leopard Cats, and commonly resulted in retribution killing of the species (McCarthy 2013). Island populations are small and seriously threatened in the Philippines and Japan. Leopard Cats can hybridize with domestic cats, as is shown by the popular domestic breed, the Bengal Cat although most of these exotic cats are now bred from Bengal Cat stock rather than wild crosses (TICA, The International Cat Association 2012). Hybridization in the wild has been reported, but is not considered a significant threat. Although this species is less dependent on forest cover than others, habitat loss and fragmentation is still a threat across most of its range (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","Mohamed et al.</em></em></em> (2013) report population densities of 9.6, 12.4 and 16.5 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, from three selectively logged forest reserves in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. They also found that population density increased with forest disturbance. A similar relationship with forest disturbance was found in the Western Ghats, India, but densities here were generally lower at 10.45 and 4.48 individuals/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;from Badhra and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserves, respectively (Srivathsa et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Across most of its range the Leopard Cat is recorded more frequently than sympatric cats (e.g. Nowell and Jackson 1996, Duckworth et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Holden 2001, Duckworth et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Lynam et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Yasuda et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Gumal et al.</em></em></em> 2014), especially in disturbed areas such as logging concessions (e.g. Ross et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Mohamed et al.</em></em></em> 2013), however, in some surveys leopard cats are recorded less frequently than other species (e.g. Pusparini et al.</em></em></em> 2014, McCarthy et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Loken et al.</em></em></em> unpublished data), particularly in areas of primary forest (e.g. Ross et al.</em></em></em> 2010, McCarthy et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data). Leopard Cats have also been detected in oil palm plantations (Ross et al.</em></em></em> 2010, Rajaratnam et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Yue et al.</em></em></em> in press), however, fewer individual Leopard Cats were detected, and the detection rate was lower, in a survey of a large oil palm plantation, located at a greater distance from natural or semi-natural vegetation, compared to a smaller plantation, located close to natural vegetation, (Hearn, Ross and Macdonald unpublished data), suggesting that proximity to surrounding forest remains an important factor.<br/><br/>With a wide distribution and tolerance to human modified landscapes the Leopard Cat’s population is abundant. However, it is not invulnerable to habitat loss and degradation and this, coupled with hunting, is likely causing population declines in some regions (e.g. Seto et al.</em></em></em> 2012, Wilcox et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Coudrat et al.</em></em></em> 2014a, Coudrat et al.</em></em></em> 2014b). In the late 1980s on average 200,000 Leopard Cat skins were exported from China (Nowell and Jackson 1996), although the actual harvest was likely much higher, possibly up to 400,000 (Yu 2010). Although the Leopard Cat is more tolerant to habitat disturbance than sympatric felids it likely experiences higher mortality rates in these areas (e.g. Rajaratnam 2000). Haines et al.</em></em></em> (2004) report survival rates of 92% in a protected area compared with only 53-82% in areas with higher human activity. <br/><br/>Island populations are particularly at risk of extinction, with the Iriomote Cat P.b. iriomotensis</em> listed as Critically Endangered, and the Visayan Leopard Cat P.b. rabori</em> of the Philippine islands of Panay, Negros, Cebu and possibly Masbate listed as Vulnerable. The small population (approximately 100) on Japan's 710 km<sup>2</sup> Tsushima Island, considered the same subspecies as that which occurs in northeast mainland Asia, has decreased over the last 30-40 years (Izawa et al.</em></em></em> 2007). The population of the Western Ghats, India is geographically isolated due to a climate barrier and should be managed as a discrete conservation unit (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em> 2010).",,Stable,"The Leopard Cat is a widespread species. It is found through parts of India, west into Pakistan and Afghanistan (Habibi 2003), through the Himalayan foothills, throughout most of China, and north to the Korean peninsula and into the Russian Far East (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Its range extends south throughout Southeast Asia, and includes the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Taiwan. The Leopard Cat is found on numerous small offshore islands of mainland Asia (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).

Skins are also used as decorations in some parts of its range. Leopard Cats are occasionally kept as pets, sometimes taken from the wild and sometimes from captive breeding and they have been interbred with domestic cats, particularly in the West, to make the popular Bengal breed.

It was formerly also distributed in southern Thailand but the last confirmed observation was almost 20 years ago (Wilting et al</em>. 2010). Current status distribution is limited to presence data, and there are few records in comparison with sympatric small felids. The extent to which this reflects patterns of survey design and effort rather than patterns of distribution is unclear. Wetland destruction and degradation and the very high deforestation rate in southeast Asia is the primary threat faced by the species (Wilting et al</em>. 2010). Since 2010 there have been few new photo captures of this species with camera traps. The reason for this can be due to the special wetland-based ecology of the species, but as they have been previously photographed on main roads, as well as in the forest and along trails, it is believed unlikely to be the sole reason. It was photographed only a few times in the Kinabatangan area of Sabah, of Borneo (an area thought to have the best habitat for the species), despite hundreds of camera traps (A. Hearn pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Over 45% of protected wetlands and 94% of globally significant wetlands in Southeast Asia are considered threatened (Dugan 1993) and although the situation today is unknown, it is unlikely to be radically better and may be much worse. Causes include human settlement, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid. While there have been observations of the Flat-headed Cat in secondary forests (Bezuijen 2000, Meijaard et al</em>. 2005, Mohamed et al</em>. 2009), Wilting et al</em>. (2010) could not find any support that the Flat-headed Cat can also live in oil palm plantations. According to their distribution model, over 70% of its predicted historical suitable habitat has been transformed to unsuitable habitats (Wilting et al.</em> 2010). Between 2000-2010 the Flat-headed Cat lost over 20% of potentially suitable habitat (10% in Peninsular Malaysia, 17% in Borneo and 41% in Sumatra; extracted from Miettinen et al</em>. 2011). Based on these rates of habitat loss and together with other threats such as pollution of wetlands and hunting it is very likely that the Flat-headed Cat population declined by at least 20% in the last 12 years (two generations; Pacifici et al</em>. 2013) and will also continue to decline over the next 12 years by more than 20%.<br/><br/>It is difficult to estimate population size given its patchy distribution and lack of any density estimates. However the low number of camera-trapping records and direct sightings compared to other Southeast Asian cat species seem to support the notion that the Flat-headed Cat is very rare and/or very specialized in its habitat requirements. An area of occupancy map predicted a species distribution area of about 61,000 km² for Borneo (Wilting et al</em>. unpublished data of the Borneo Carnivore Symposium). For Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra we inferred that additional 10,000 km² and 8,100 km², respectively, could be occupied. If we take a density of four individuals per 100 km² within this 80,000 km², and assuming that not all individuals of a population are mature individuals we would infer a population size which is plausibly fewer than 2,500 mature individuals. For the Flat-headed Cat with its very patchy distribution and its close associations to water resources the average density of four individuals per 100 km² is rather conservative, although in some well suitable areas the density might also be much higher than this. Using a higher average density (&gt;5 mature individulas per 100 km²) would lead to population estimates which would qualify the species as Vulnerable (C1). The IUCN Red List Guidelines (vers. 11, Feb 2014) caution that multiplying density times area extent often leads to “gross overestimation” of the number of mature individuals. Although density estimations of Flat-headed Cats would be needed to verify the inferred numbers, the great threat to Southeast Asian wetlands further supports the classification as Endangered under the precautionary principle.<a name=""_GoBack""></a>","Very little is known about this species, and the available information suggest that, like its close relative the fishing cat, the Flat-headed Cat is strongly associated with wetlands and preys primarily on fish. Stomach contents of two dead animals contained mostly fish, and also shrimp shells. They may also take birds and small rodents, and have been reported to prey on domestic poultry (Nowell and Jackson 1996).<br/> <br/> Most records for the Flat-headed Cat are from swampy areas, lakes and streams, and riverine forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Yasuda et al.</em> 2007). They also occur in peat-swamp forest (Bezuijen 2000), and have been observed in secondary forest (Bezuijen 2000, Bezuijen 2003, Meijaard et al.</em> 2005, Mohamed et al.</em> 2009). All published observations of live animals have taken place at night or early morning, near water (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Bezuijen 2000, Bezuijen 2003, Meijaard et al.</em> 2005, Yasuda et al.</em> 2007). Over 80% of the records gathered by Wilting et al.</em> (2010) were from elevations below 100 m asl, and over 70 % were recorded within a distance of three km to larger water sources. <br/> <br/> The Flat-headed Cat takes its name from its unusually long, sloping snout and flattened skull roof, with small ears set well down the sides of its head. It has large, close-set eyes, and relatively longer and sharper teeth than its close relatives. Its claws do not fully retract into their shortened sheaths, and its toes are more completely webbed than the Fishing Cat's, with long narrow foot pads. Muul and Lim (1970), commenting on the cat's feet and other features, termed it the ecological counterpart of a semi-aquatic mustelid.","<p></p><p>Wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation is the primary threat faced by the species (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Wilting et al.</em> 2010). Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves over the past decade has been rapid in Tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments and is likely to be a significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat (Wilting et al. </em>2010). Trapping, snaring and poisoning are also threats: E. Bennett (in Sunquist and Sunquist 2002) reported that skins were frequently seen in longhouses in the interior of Sarawak, and the Flat-headed Cat has been captured in traps set out to protect domestic fowl (Nowell and Jackson 1996).</p>","<p></p><p>The Flat-headed Cat is closely associated with wetlands and lowland forests, habitats which are increasingly being occupied and modified by people (Wilting et al.</em> 2010). It has never been studied, there are few records of the species, and it is generally considered rare, with a highly localized distribution around bodies of water (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Anonymous 1996, Bezuijen 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Meijaard et al.</em> 2005, Yasuda et al.</em> 2007, Barita and Boeadi pers. comm. 2006, Mohamed et al.</em> 2009). Although fishermen along the Merang River in south Sumatra (which has relatively intact peat forests) described it as common (Bezuijen 2000), they tend to use a single generic term for both Flat-headed Cat and Leopard Cat Prionailurus bengalensis</em>, a more abundant species (Bezuijen 2003). Most of the recent records come from Sabah in northeastern Borneo, where it can be frequently be observed along the Kinabatangan River (Wilting et al.</em> 2010), and where it has been several times recorded by camera-traps in Deramakot and Tangkulap Forest Reserve (Mohamed et al.</em> 2009). Recently camera-trapping records come from a mixed-used plantation area, which includes conservation reserves within the oil palm estates in East Kalimantan (Wahyudi and Struebing 2013) and from Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia (Wadey et al.</em> 2014).</p>",,Decreasing,"The Flat-headed Cat has a restricted distribution, found only on Sumatra, Borneo and the Malayan Peninsula (Malaysia and extreme southern Thailand).

Nevertheless, preliminary analysis on available data suggests that the species is negatively impacted by intensive irrigated agriculture that has fragmented its prime habitat and perhaps also its population in India (see Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;The absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, a future prediction on population decline can be made based on available information on the geographical range of the species, niche model analysis and current change in land use regimes.<br/><br/>Most of the distributional range of the species in India and Nepal lies outside the protected area network and in the deciduous forests of central India which are severely disturbed. The total extent of prime habitat in India and Nepal is around 25% of the total distributional range within these countries.<br/><br/>The current (2015) Government of India has made provisions for speedy approval of developmental projects in non-protected areas including areas under mining, industrialisation and urbanisation (Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Moreover, there are plans for expanding the national area under agriculture by 10% by 2017 (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014), a development which will continue in the future. Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species are rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy since the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. The impact of this development on persistence of biodiversity remains unclear.<br/><br/>Assuming 10 years as the average life span of the Rusty-spotted Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year, we estimate the average age of mature individuals (Generation Length - GL) in the current population at around 4 years, using the formula by Pacifici et al.</em> (2013): GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3, Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR). In the next three Rusty-spotted Cat generations, i.e. 12 years, the prime locations where populations are likely to persist are protected areas as these are the only zones remaining close to intact. This translates to 75% of habitat in the current distributional range facing an imminent danger of being converted. As much of this is marginal habitat for the species, a 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over the next three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population and therefore has a concomitantly greater contribution to the overall ‘average’ global change.<br/><br/>Therefore, a future decline of 20-25% over the next three generations is suspected, occurring primarily due to projected habitat loss in central India, with populations stable only in protected areas and little information available about the small proportion of the population found in Sri Lanka.","Though the species is also found in proximity to human habitation (Worah 1991, Nowell and Jackson 1996, Mukherjee 1998, Nekaris 2003), preliminary results of a study using niche models and known Rusty-spotted Cat locations within India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material), suggests that at a broad scale this cat’s distribution is limited by large contiguous tracts of hostile habitat, specifically intensive, irrigated agriculture (Silva et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These results were a consensus of four models that incorporated land cover, bioclimatic variables and disturbance measures with 61 location points of the species. The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country, indicative of a fragmented population (Silva et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>There are recent records of the Rusty-spotted Cat from the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka in small, mostly isolated forest patches (&lt;5 km²) interspersed with tea estates but it is not known if the species occurs in or uses the tea plantation areas (Andrew Kittle in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). <br/><br/>A few observations suggest that the species preys on rodents (Kunal Patel and Vidya Athreya in litt.</em></em></em></em></em>).","Habitat loss and the spread of cultivation are serious problems for wildlife in South Asia. The total extent of prime habitat of the Rusty-spotted Cat in India and Nepal is equivalent to around 25% of the range of the species in these countries. These are perhaps the only areas where populations of the species are likely to persist in the future. This translates to 75% of the current habitat in India and Nepal facing an imminent danger of conversion to urban areas, industry, mining and other forms of land use hostile to Rusty-spotted Cat (Bhardwaj and Dutta 2014, Mazoomdaar 2015 a,b). Apart from agriculture and industry, parts of the Central Indian landscape within the range of the species is rapidly being converted for establishing solar plants as an alternative source of generating energy during the past few years (Sharma 2015). Since the climate summit of 2015, this is bound to increase given India’s strong commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. Categorization of certain portions of the species’s habitat (scrub, degraded forest) as wasteland facilitates such conversion (Mukherjee and Koparde in prep.). <br/><br/>As much of the distributional range constitutes marginal habitat for the species, this 75% loss of habitat could translate to a decline of around 20-25% (assuming 70-80% of the population resides in prime habitat and a relatively direct relationship between loss of habitat and loss of mature individuals) of the current population over three generations. Given the much smaller landmass of Sri Lanka, the mainland population constitutes perhaps 90% or a little more of the global population<br/><br/>Since much of the species’s range is within hugely human-dominated areas undergoing rapid land use change, fragmentation of habitat and disease should be considered as serious threats. There are concerns regarding possible hybridization of Rusty-spotted Cat with domestic cats (Kittle and Watson 2004) but these have yet to be substantiated and measured to determine if this factor is indeed a threat to the species. There is a belief that Rusty-spotted Cats do not get into conflict, unlike Jungle Cats, since they are believed not to prey on poultry (Manakadan and Sivakumar 2006). However, this needs to be backed by research and the threats need to be evaluated across the species’s global distribution. <br/><br/>Reflecting the uncertainty of this assessment, the species should be prioritised for research and monitoring.","Information on this species is not just meagre but also incidental and hence it is difficult to infer, with confidence, its population size, connectivity between populations, threats, and persistence in the future. It appears to be rare almost wherever it occurs (Kunal Patel and Andrew Kittle in litt.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). <br/><br/>Population trend: the absence of any earlier systematic survey makes it difficult to gauge if populations have declined, increased or are stable. However, the niche model from India (Figure 1 in Supplementary Material) suggests a fragmented population.&#160;The analysis also shows that prime habitat for this species occurs in three broad regions within the country (Silva et al.</em> 2015).&#160;These prime regions correspond with dry and moist deciduous forests showing relatively low forest fragmentation according to landuse and land cover maps for India (Roy&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012).",,Decreasing,"The Rusty-spotted Cat was earlier believed to be restricted to India and Sri Lanka but recent photographic records show its presence in Bardia National Park, Nepal (Ramjan Choudhary and Rabin Kadariya in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), bordering India. Its geographical distribution is as yet not clearly documented but recent locality records suggest it is more widespread than earlier believed (Chakraborty 1978, Phillips 1984, Wright 1984, Miththapala 2006, Athreya 2010, Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Anwar et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Raza Kazmi in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Jugal Tiwari in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Anonymous 2013, Dharmendra Khandal in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Pankaj Koparde and Gaurang Gowande in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,&#160;Ramjan Choudhary and&#160;Rabin Kadariya in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Andrew Kittle in litt.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Nevertheless it has a relatively restricted global distribution for a cat and little is known of its ecology or local abundance (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).

A severe paucity of recent records in Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Java, and, if the species occurs there at all, Lao PDR, indicate that these populations are very small, and have been since at least 2000. There are no recent records from Sumatra (Indonesia), where the species has never been confirmed to occur, although in the light of only limited appropriate survey effort in these areas, the species’s current status should be considered unknown. In South Asia, although relatively widespread, it occurs largely in human-dominated landscapes (often hugely so), which are under locally severe threat from urbanization (Sri Lanka and India) and industrialization (India). Estimates of population size and trend, and of extents of habitat, are very speculative, given that research on this species has been initiated only in 2009 (Cutter 2015). Yet, research reveals a declining population facing an array of severe threats from habitat destruction to active persecution due to perceived conflict (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Cutter 2015, Adhya 2016). Poaching and retribution killing were the major causes for a high Fishing Cat mortality of 84% in Thailand, where 16 individuals have been monitored over a three-year radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015). <br/><br/>The current known global Fishing Cat strongholds are Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Bengal in India and the Terai-Duar belt of the Himalayan foothills in India and Nepal. Habitat loss along with the killing of Fishing Cats because of conflict with local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside these strongholds, declines may be considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal are likely in the next 15 years (Ashan Thudugala, Anya Ratnayaka, Tiasa Adhya, Shomita Mukherjee, Murthy Kantimahanti, Giridhar Malla, Rama Mishra, Sagar Dahal pers. comm. 2015). These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a decrease of a further 30% in the global Fishing Cat population. Thus, the species is categorized as Vulnerable under A2cd+3cd+4cd. <br/><br/>The change in Red List category is a non-genuine change reflecting the very recent increase in information quality; it does not indicate an improved conservation status for the species since the last assessment.","In India the Fishing Cat is strongly associated with water bodies, marshlands constituting tall bed-forming graminoid species like the reed Phragmites vallatoria</em>, the reedmace Typha elephantina</em> and locally cultivated grass species like Saccharum narenga</em> and swamps (Adhya 2015). Most known records are from the lowlands, but in Sri Lanka Fishing Cat occurs also in wetlands in hilly areas (Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is largely nocturnal (Mukherjee 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Lynam et al.</em></em></em> 2013). It is a dietary generalist consuming a variety of prey such as murid rodents, birds and fish (Mukherjee 1989, Haque and Vijayan 1993, Adhya 2015). Two species of rodents that figured prominently in the diet of the Fishing Cat from the Howrah district of West Bengal, a rapidly developing urbanised zone, were Rattus rattus</em> (sensu lato) and Bandicota bengalensis</em>. A conservative estimate of rodent consumption by the Fishing Cat suggests that each individual eats between 365 and 730 rodents per year (Adhya 2015).<br/><br/>A radio-telemetry study on four Fishing Cats in Chitwan National Park in Nepal showed that they mostly used dense tall and short grasslands; the home ranges of three females was estimated at 4-6 km² while that of a single male was estimated at 16-22 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A more recent radio-telemetry study in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, demonstrated that protection of resources such as food and daytime resting sites and reduction of poaching can ensure the persistence of the Fishing Cat in human-modified agricultural areas (Cutter and Cutter 2009). A 84% mortality of radio-collared cats, due to poaching and unknown causes, was reported during the three-year study (Cutter 2015).<br/><br/>Generation Length (GL) was estimated at 5 years, using the Pacifici et al.</em></em></em> (2013) formula, GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], [where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3]; Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR), assuming 12 years as the average life span of the Fishing Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year.","The Fishing Cat faces a high risk of extinction throughout its range and is thought to be amongst the most vulnerable of the small and medium-sized cats in Southeast Asia, reflecting the very low overlap of occupied habitat with protected areas and other conservation interventions, rather than any particular inherent higher susceptibility than shown by the other small cats (e.g. Duckworth et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The major threat across its South Asian range appears to be habitat loss and fragmentation by developmental activities such as urbanization, industrialization, agriculture and aquaculture (prawn and shrimp farms), whereas in Southeast Asia persecution is the major threat (Melisch et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Willcox et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, Cutter (2015) reported 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats during the study period. Of 16 Fishing Cats that were radio-collared, three could not be located and could have either dispersed or died. Of the remaining 13, only two survived the almost three-year study period while five were poached and six died of unknown causes. Five dead cats were located. In one case the poacher who shot an animal reported the cause of death when he returned its ear tag. &#160;<br/><br/>In India, much of its habitat comprises freshwater marshlands which are categorised as ‘wastelands’ under land use policies and are thus subject to conversion and degradation (Adhya 2015). Linked to this is conflict with humans, which is believed to be aggravated by habitat fragmentation and sharing of resources such as space (wetlands) and food (fish, goats, poultry) (Melisch et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Kolipaka 2006, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). Poisoning, trapping and clubbing seem to be common methods to kill Fishing Cats across the species’ range. A survey in West Bengal recorded 27 deaths of Fishing Cats between April 2010 and May 2011 in that year in the Howrah district (1,600 km²) (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In Bangladesh, a compilation of reports from newspaper articles and web-based searches on the Fishing Cat (deaths, captures, rescues and releases) revealed 82 records and 30 confirmed deaths over a three-year period from January 2010 to March 2013 (Chowdhury et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In both areas, almost all deaths could be traced to local people killing the cats (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). It should be taken as the minimum number killed because not all instances are recorded. In the Sundarbans of India, local people from Sagar Island admitted to having exterminated the cat from their island (Mukherjee et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). Chowdhury et al.</em></em></em></em> (2015) noted that in Bangladesh and India more than 70% of the deaths occurred during the dry season, perhaps when Fishing Cat and human resources overlap maximally. A recent study (Adhya 2015) in the Howrah district of West Bengal reveals that Fishing Cat diet is largely composed of small mammals, fish and birds with a negligible portion (less than 5%) comprising of livestock and surmises that the killings are based on a perception of conflict because of the presence of the cat.<br/><br/>In Cambodia the Fishing Cat is killed by locals for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Such killings probably occur throughout its Southeast Asian range.","Fishing Cat populations and habitat in Southeast Asia are severely stressed and the species’ current stronghold is in eastern and southern parts of South Asia. According to Melisch et al.</em></em> (1996), in West Java, Fishing Cat populations were fragmented and restricted to coastal areas. However, this was in the 1990s and the evidence was based solely on visual identification of tracks and scats, which may not be reliable; the last photographic evidence of the species in the wild on Java dates to 2000 (A. Compost in litt.</em></em> 2012). The Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson in litt.</em></em> 2016). It is unclear the extent, if any, to which these surveys covered microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat. In sum, it is impossible to speculate on current population size in Java, if the species even survives there at all. In Viet Nam the species is perhaps extinct in most or even all of its former range but it was confirmed to persist in the Mekong Delta until at least 2000 (Willcox et al.</em></em> 2014). It is not known if it ever occurred in the Red River Delta; given general levels of hunting and persecution in the country it seems unlikely that any large population remains anywhere in Viet Nam (Daniel Willcox in litt.</em></em> 2015). <br/><br/>In Thailand too, the species seems to be highly localised and recent surveys and incidental records suggest that it is restricted to coastal parts of Central and Southern Thailand (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Buatip et al.</em></em> 2013, Tantipisanuh et al.</em></em> 2014). There is at least one historical Thai specimen identified as this species from well inland (Duckworth et al.</em></em> 2010), but the extent to which the species ever occurred widely across inland Thailand, if at all, remains unclear. Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, coastal Thailand, (Cutter 2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats due to poaching and unknown causes over her three-year study period.<br/><br/>Its presence in the Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar was recently confirmed (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2016), but there is no indication of the population size there, although given the extent of the habitat it could be large. <br/><br/>Extensive camera-trapping in the general area of the only historical locality record from Myanmar, the Hukaung Valley, did not find the species, but camera-traps were not set to target this species, so it is unclear whether it persists there (Than Zaw et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South Asia, the Fishing Cat is currently widespread in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The Pakistan population of Fishing Cat was feared to be close to extinction (Roberts 1977), but there are camera-trap records of Fishing Cat from the Chotiari Reservoir in the Sindh Province of Pakistan (Islam et al.</em></em> 2015) and recent reports of individuals being sold in local markets in Karachi (Faraz Zubairi in litt.</em></em> 2015). In Sri Lanka and in India there are small populations of Fishing Cat in densely human-populated urban areas (Adhya et al.</em></em> 2011, Ratnayaka 2016). In Nepal it occurs along a narrow stretch bounding India, in the Terai region (Sagar Dahal in litt.</em></em> 2015). It seems to be relatively safe in some protected areas in India, especially those under the Project Tiger scheme, such as Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, at the Indo-Nepal border and the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve bordering Bangladesh. In Bangladesh the Fishing Cat seems to be relatively safe in mangrove forests of the Sundarbans and in the north-eastern swamps (Rahman et al.</em></em> 2016). However, on both sides of the India-Bangladesh border, very few surveys have been undertaken to assess the status and distribution of the Fishing Cat across the salinity gradient of the mangrove region.<br/><br/>A molecular analysis of population connectivity in India suggested that in the past Fishing Cat populations within India were connected from the Terai region of the Himalayan foothills to the Coringa mangroves in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast (Mukherjee et al.</em></em> 2012). However, this analysis was restricted to the mitochondrial genome and is not comprehensive. Several small pockets of populations survive across the eastern coast and eastern states of India, and many are perhaps yet to be discovered (Adhya et al.</em></em> 2011, Murthy Kantimahanti and Giridhar Malla in litt.</em></em> 2015). Similarly, in the western semi-arid part of India a recent record in Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (Sadhu and Reddy 2013) and protected wetlands in the areas neighbouring Rajasthan such as Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary near Agra (Baiju Raj in litt.</em></em> 2016) suggest that populations either exist in pockets or are long-distance dispersers tracking suitable habitats. Extensive surveys are required to clarify this. Fishing Cat was thought to be extinct in Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Rajasthan, by 2007 (Mukherjee et al.</em></em> 2012), but a later survey recorded an individual, and though numbers may be drastically reduced, some individuals may still persist there (Mukherjee et al.</em></em> 2012, Abrar Khan pers. comm. 2011). North-eastern India is another region where the species is recorded from pockets e.g. Manas (Qamar Qureshi in litt.</em></em> 2016) and Kaziranga Tiger Reserves (Qamar Qureshi in litt.</em></em> 2016) in Assam and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2003, Aparajita Dutta in litt.</em></em> 2012). Though there have been several camera-trap surveys in this region targeting Tiger, these may not have adequately covered the habitat of Fishing Cat. Focussed surveys along the several river courses in the region are required to gauge population connectivity and status of Fishing Cat.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and destruction along with the killing of Fishing Cats by local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more, in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside the strongholds, declines may have been considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue currently, and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal and 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta are likely in the next 15 years. These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a drop of a further 30% in the global population.",,Decreasing,"The natural distribution of the Fishing Cat is unclear throughout its global range, with many unauthenticated, ambiguous and erroneous records clouding understanding (Pocock 1939, Duckworth et al.</em> 2009, Janardhanan et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016, Duckworth 2016, Willcox 2016). In addition the species is not well recorded by typical modern general faunal surveys, meaning that absence of records from areas without specific Fishing Cat surveys should not be taken to imply absence of the species (Duckworth et al.</em> 2009, 2010, Janardhanan et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016). Other factors also hinder determination of current range: putative introductions, sporadic records from regions not included in past distribution assessments, persistence in small pockets but with drastically reduced numbers and potentially amid areas of widespread extirpation, and possible recent extinctions through much of its range (Adhya et al.</em> 2011, Mukherjee et al.</em> 2012, Willcox et al.</em> 2014, Adhya 2016, Duckworth 2016, Kantimahanti 2016, Mukherjee 2016, Willcox 2016). &#160;<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia from Pakistan in the west to Cambodia in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to Sri Lanka and peninsular Thailand in the south. Its distribution was probably always patchy because of its strong association with wetlands. Current known occurrence is extremely localized across the range except for West Bengal in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.&#160; Results of a molecular analysis of Fishing Cat faeces from five protected areas in India indicated that in the past Fishing Cat populations were connected from the Terai in northern India to the Coringa mangroves on India's east coast; it is unknown whether contemporary populations are still connected physically (Mukherjee et al.</em> 2012, Mukherjee 2016). Also unknown is whether population units in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion at the base of the Himalayas are connected outside protected areas or along river courses.<br/><br/>More recently, the species has been recorded in areas where it was never observed before, such as in southern Andhra Pradesh, India, and in the far south of coastal Thailand. It had presumably been overlooked in these areas previously; they are unlikely to indicate recent range extension. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia its occurrence is likely to be extremely patchy in Viet Nam, Lao PDR (if it occurs there at all), Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Java, Indonesia.<br/><br/>Detailed country-wise distributions are provided below:<br/><br/>Pakistan: this population was thought to be close to extinction in the early 1970s (Roberts 1977), but Islam et al.</em> (2015) camera-trapped individuals in the Chotiari Reservoir area in the Sanghar District of Sindh Province. There are also reports of individuals being sold and seized in a wildlife market in Karachi (Bhatti 2015, Faraz Ubairi in litt.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Nepal: intensive camera trapping surveys for Tiger Panthera tigris</em> monitoring since 2008 corroborated the Fishing Cat's presence in Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the far western Terai, but failed to record it in Bardia National Park (Babu Ram Lamichhane and Shailendra Yadav pers. comm. 2016). It is present in and around Jagadishpur Reservoir, a Ramsar site in south-western Nepal (Dahal et al.</em> 2015) and in Chitwan National Park in the central Terai (Dahal and Dahal 2011, Mishra 2016). In south-eastern Nepal, it has been recorded in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (Pandey et al.</em> 2012, Taylor et al.</em> 2016, Sagar Dahal and Angie Appel in litt.</em> 2016). Whether these populations are connected outside protected areas remains unknown.<br/><br/>India: protected areas hosting Fishing Cat populations include Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh (Mukherjee et al.</em> 2012, Baiju Raj in litt.</em> 2016), Corbett Tiger Reserve, Uttarakhand (Abishek Harihar in litt.</em> 2012), Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in West Bengal (Yadavendradev Jhala in litt.</em> 2015), Keoladeo Ghana National Park (Mukherjee et al.</em> 2012) and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan (Sadhu and Reddy 2013), Kaziranga Karbi Anglong Landscape (Jimmy Borah in litt.</em> 2012) and Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam (Qamar Qureshi in litt.</em> 2016), Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar (Qamar Qureshi in litt.</em> 2016), Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh (Mukherjee et al.</em> 2012, Malla and Sivakumar 2014) and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Aparajita Datta in litt.</em> 2012). Outside protected areas, records exist from Pilibhit Forest Division in Uttar Pradesh (Meraj Anwar in litt.</em> 2011), in small wetland patches in West Bengal near Kolkata and its suburbs like the Howrah and Hooghly districts (Anonymous 1989, Adhya et al.</em> 2011), in Medinipur and Nadia districts and in the human-dominated north-eastern part of Chilika Lake and Tangi district in Odisha (Tiasa Adhya in litt.</em> 2016). The Fishing Cat has also been recorded recently in areas lacking historical records viz. the Krishna River mangroves in Andhra Pradesh (Kantimahanti 2016). There are also historical statements of occurrence in the Western Ghats and the western coast of India (Pocock 1939), which have not been confirmed by recent targeted searches and may have been in error (Janardhanan et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In the Duars of north-eastern India, superficially suitable habitat may extend into Bhutan, but a number of general surveys there have not recorded the species (e.g. Tempa et al.</em> 2013, Banerjee and Bandopadhyay 2016).<br/><br/>Sri Lanka: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas along the coast and in the island's interior (Andrew Kittle in litt.</em> 2012). Individuals have also been recorded in densely human-populated urban areas of Colombo and outside protected areas in Kandy, Mathle and Nuwaraeliya districts (Ratnayaka 2016, Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>Bangladesh: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas of the Sundarbans (Rahman 2016, Adam Barlow pers. comm. 2016), in unprotected wetlands in the Brahmaputra river basin (Rahman and McCarthy 2014, Chowdhury et al.</em> 2015) and in the Chittagong hill tracts (Chakma 2015, Karim and Ahsan 2016). However, Chakma (2015) obtained only three potential records of which two were pugmarks and one was a video from a camera-trap which was not authenticated as Fishing Cat and could have been a Leopard Cat P. bengalensis.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, there are only two certain field records: one from the early 20th century in the Hukaung Valley in the north, and one from Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary in the Ayeyarwady (= Irrawaddy) delta in or around 2015 (Than Zaw in litt.</em> 2016). This corroborates reports that a few captive individuals in the country are said to be descendants of animals captured in or around the 1990s in the Ayeyarwady delta (Than Zaw et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Thailand: during targeted surveys Fishing Cat was recorded inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park and Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area along the coast, but not in protected areas farther inland that were previously thought to harbour Fishing Cat (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh et al.</em> 2014). An incidental record came from the coast in southern Thailand (Buatip et al.</em> 2013; confirmed by photograph examined by J.W. Duckworth and W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2016), which constitutes the southernmost valid record with a precise locality to date in mainland Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Cambodia: camera-trap records are scarce and limited to Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in the country's north-east (Rainey and Kong 2010), and mangrove habitats in Peam Krasaop Wildlife Sanctuary and Ream National Park on the coast (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Despite extensive camera-trapping in eastern and northern Cambodia including Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in recent years, Fishing Cat was not recorded. (Edwards et al.</em> 2012, Gray et al.</em> 2012, Simon Mahood pers. comm. 2016). A kitten found orphaned in Botum-Sakor National Park was identified as Fishing Cat, but may have been a Leopard Cat (Royan 2009). Of many other claims in the last 15 years, most are certainly in error, but a critical evaluation of all has not been performed.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR most claims are either in certain error or non-assessable; only one sounds credible but this is a sight-record that cannot be validated (Duckworth et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Viet Nam: Fishing Cat may persist in the Mekong Delta, where it was last camera-trapped in 2000 (Willcox 2016). There is a very small possibility that it occurs in the Red River Delta (where it has never been confirmed), though there have been no targeted surveys to be confident of genuine absence or local extinction (Willcox et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Indonesia: it is known to have occurred only along the west and north coast of Java within 15 km of the coast (Sody 1936, Melisch et al.</em> 1996), but there are no records of wild-living individuals since 2000. The inferences of Melisch et al.</em> (1996) are based on a single track and some scats, neither of which can be treated as conclusive evidence. Alain Compost photographed Fishing Cats in Java in the 1990s and suggested that some may still survive in the Banten Bay region and in Ujung Kulon National Park (Alain Compost in litt.</em> 2012). Until 2000, he photographed Fishing Cats in Pulau Dua Bird Sanctuary, a protected mangrove forest on the northern coast, but learned of all Fishing Cats been poisoned there by 2006 (Alain Compost in litt.</em> 2012). Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros Rhinoceros sondaicus</em> in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson in litt.</em> 2016); the overlap, if any, of camera-trap stations with microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat is not known.<br/><br/>There is no certain record from Sumatra, but historical testimony from a hunter who was familiar with the species from Java, and a captive individual in the 2000s in a local zoo indicate that the species might inhabit the island (Duckworth et al.</em> 2009, contra Sanderson 2009).<br/><br/>Occurrence in Peninsular Malaysia is also open to doubt (Duckworth et al.</em> 2009), but the Thai locality record in Buatip et al.</em> (2013) is very close to the Malaysian border. Past claims for Borneo, Taiwan and China lack any credible basis (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Jutzeler et al.</em> 2010). <br/><br/>The species is known from sea level in parts of its range, and in the northern parts it is likely to occur only in the lowlands. Recent reliable elevation records in the Terai of India and Nepal are all from below 150 m, such as Pilibhit Forest Division and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (Meraj Anwar in litt.</em> 2016), Jagadishpur Reservoir area, Chitwan National Park (Dahal et al.</em> 2015, Dahal and Dahal 2012) and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve area (Angie Appel in litt.</em> 2016), except one at 330 m on the southern edge of Corbett Tiger Reserve (Abishek Harihar in litt.</em> 2012). However, Pocock (1939) accepted a Fishing Cat skin from Barkot near Dehra Dun on the banks of the upper Yamuna river as evidence of at least occasional high-altitude occurrence at about 5,000 ft (ca. 1,500 m), but did not explain whether this individual was killed there, or whether there was any possibility that, while a skin had been procured at that altitude, the animal had originated elsewhere. In Sri Lanka, Fishing Cat has been recorded at elevations up to 1,800 m (Ashan Thudugala in litt.</em> 2016). However, the Sri Lankan altitudinal range seems to be an exception as all other authentic locality records are much lower than that.","The Fishing Cat is killed for consumption and a very recent report from Howrah district, India, reveals the rampant killing of the species outside protected areas in human-dominated landscapes for consumption as part of a cultural practice. Such cases most often go unnoticed or are ignored unless some interested people and non-governmental organisations pursue the case until the perpetrators are convicted (Adhya 2015). In Cambodia, the Fishing Cat is killed by local people for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). In Thailand a radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015) demonstrated that poaching is a major threat when five of 16 radio-collared individuals were killed by poachers (for consumption and retaliation) within the three-year study period. Cutter (2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared individuals attributed to poaching and unknown causes. Opportunistic trading of skins and potentially other parts is likely to occur in mainland Southeast Asia, where such trading is at very high levels and involves a wide diversity of species (e.g. Willcox et al.</em> 2014), but there is no evidence of its being particularly sought after there. Similarly, in Java individuals are sometimes seen in the island’s intensive live animal (‘pet’) trade (e.g. Duckworth et al.</em> 2009), but again there is no indication that it is (yet) a specific target.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Fishing Cat is included in CITES Appendix II and protected by national legislation over most of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam Fishing Cat has the highest level of protection under the main species protection law (decree 32/2006/ND-CP) and is included in appendix I B. This completely prohibits any exploitation or commercial trade. There is no protection afforded outside protected areas in Nepal (Karan B. Shah, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Since 1985, the Fishing Cat has been confirmed to occur in protected areas (but it should not be assumed necessarily to survive in all) including the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and India; Suklaphanta, Chitwan and Koshi Tappu in Nepal; Corbett, Dudwha, Keoladeo Ghana, Coringa and Kaziranga in India; Yala, Wilpattu, Maduru Oya, Horton Plains, Dunumadallawa, Kalametiya, Sinharaja, Bundala and Uda Walawe in Sri Lanka; Khao Sam Roi Yot and Thale Noi in Thailand; Kulen Promtep, Peam Krasaop and Ream in Cambodia. Several wetlands that hold Fishing Cat populations are listed under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of important wetlands, e.g. Sundarbans in Bangladesh, Chilika Lake, Keoladeo Ghana and East Kolkata Wetlands in India, Jagadishpur Reservoir in Nepal and Chotiari Reservoir in Pakistan.<br/><br/>The survival of the species depends on adequate protection of remaining wetlands in Asia, and prevention of indiscriminate trapping, snaring and poisoning.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
97216466,18868,Puma concolor,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern because it is one of the most widely-distributed mammals in the Western Hemisphere. Although it has been extirpated from its former range in midwestern and eastern North America (Nowell and Jackson 1996), it is attempting to recolonize this region (Thompson and Jenks 2010, LaRue et al.</em> 2012) and populations are healthy enough for regulated harvest in western North America. However, it is considered to be declining elsewhere in its range, and as a large carnivore intricately linked to other wildlife and habitat associations, from a social and political perspective its conservation and management presents numerous challenges.","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, in all forest types, as well as lowland and montane desert.  Several studies have shown that habitat with dense understory vegetation is preferred, however, Pumas can live in very open habitats with only a minimum of vegetative cover (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Pumas co-occur with Jaguars in much of their Latin American range, and may favour more open habitats than their larger competitor, although both can be found in dense forest (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Pumas are capable of taking large prey, but when available small to medium-sized prey are more important in their diet (in tropical portions of the range).  This is true of wild prey as well as livestock (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  In North America, deer make up 60-80% of the Puma's diet, and the mean weight of prey taken is 39-48 kg.  In Florida, however, where deer numbers are low, Pumas take smaller prey including feral pigs, raccoons and armadillos, and deer account for only about 1/3 of the diet (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Pumas vary considerably across their geographic distribution, and the smallest ranges tend to occur in areas where prey densities are high and prey are not migratory (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  In North America, home range sizes ranged from 32-1,031 km<sup>2</sup> (Lindzey et al.</em> 1987).","Pumas are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching of their wild prey base.  They are persecuted across their range by retaliatory hunting due to livestock depredation, and due to fear that they pose a threat to human life (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  Pumas have killed a number of people in western Canada and the US in recent years.  Pumas are legally hunted in many western US states, although hunting was banned by popular referendum in California in 1990.  Road kills are the principal cause of mortality in the endangered Florida Panther subpopulation, and heavily travelled roads are a major barrier to Puma movements and dispersal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).","The Canadian population was roughly estimated at 3,500-5,000 and the western US population at 10,000 in the early 1990s (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  The population of Central and South America is likely much higher, although it is unclear how abundant Pumas are in the dense rainforest of the Amazon basin (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Florida subpopulation, numbering 100-180, is isolated, and has been supplemented by a reintroduction of pumas from Texas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2014). In Brazil it is considered Near Threatened but subspecies outside the Amazon basic are considered Vulnerable (Machado et al.</em></em> 2005).
